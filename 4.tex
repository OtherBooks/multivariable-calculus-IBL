#Consider a circle of radius \(r\). The area inside the circle is \(\pi r^2\). This is the area inside when you traverse around the circle for a full \(2\pi\) radians.  Fill in the following table by finding the pattern that connects angle traversed to area inside.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
Angle traversed& Area inside\\ \hline
\(2\pi\) & \(A=\pi r^2\)\\
\(\pi\) & \\
\(\pi/2\) & \\
\(\pi/4\) & \\
\(d\theta\) & \(dA=\quad\quad\)
