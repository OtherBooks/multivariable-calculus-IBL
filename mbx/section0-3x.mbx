  <title>Modification Notes</title>
  <p>
    This work is based almost entirely off of Ben Woodruff's IBL textbook (see copyright information on previous pages). Some modifications have been made by Dr. Karl Schmitt at Valparaiso University to more closely match the teaching and content for Valparaiso's Calculus III course (Math 253). In particular several chapters/units have been split apart or reorganized.
