
\noindent 
This unit covers the following ideas. In preparation for the quiz and exam, make sure you have a lesson plan containing examples that explain and illustrate the following concepts.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe uses for, and construct graphs of, space curves and parametric surfaces. Find derivatives of space curves, and use this to find velocity, acceleration, and find equations of tangent lines.
\item Describe uses for, and construct graphs of, functions of several variables. For functions of the form $z=f(x,y)$, this includes both 3D surface plots and 2D level curve plots.  For functions of the form $w=f(x,y,z)$, construct plots of level surfaces.
\item Describe uses for, and construct graphs of, vector fields and transformations.
\item If you are given a description of a vector field, curve, or surface (instead of a function or parametrization), explain how to obtain a function for the vector field, or a parametrization for the curve or surface.
\end{enumerate}
You'll have a chance to teach your examples to your peers prior to the exam.


\section{Function Terminology}
A function is a set of instructions involving two sets (called the domain and codomain).  A function assigns to each element of the domain $D$ exactly one element in the codomain $R$. We'll often refer to the codomain $R$ as the target space.  We'll write $$f\colon D\to R$$ when we want to remind ourselves of the domain and target space.  In this class, we will study what happens when the domain and target space are subsets of ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ (Euclidean $n$-space).  In particular, we will study functions of the form $$f\colon {\mathbb{R}}^n\to {\mathbb{R}}^m,$$ when $m$ and $n$ are 3 or less. The value of $n$ is the dimension of the input vector (or number of inputs).  The number $m$ is the dimension of the output vector (or number of outputs).  Our goal is to understand uses for each type of function, and be able to construct graphs to represent the function.

We will focus most of our time this semester on two- and three-dimensional problems. However, many problems in the real world require a higher number of dimensions. When you hear the word ``dimension'', it does not always represent a physical dimension, such as length, width, or height.  If a quantity depends on 30 different measurements, then the problem involves 30 dimensions.  As a quick illustration, the formula for the distance between two points depends on 6 numbers, so distance is really a 6-dimensional problem.  As another example, if a piece of equipment has a color, temperature, age, and cost, we can think of that piece of equipment being represented by a point in four-dimensional space (where the coordinate axes represent color, temperature, age, and cost).

% As we introduce each type of function, we'll introduce it in the context of a somewhat realistic setting.  
% After introducing each type of surface, we'll end this chapter with an assortment of functions to practice graphing.

A horse runs around an elliptical track. Its position at time $t$ is given by the  function $\vec r(t)=(2\cos t, 3\sin t).$ We could alternatively write this as $x=2\cos t, y=3\sin t$. 
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item What are $n$ and $m$ when we write this function in the form  $\vec r\colon {\mathbb{R}}^n\to {\mathbb{R}}^m$?
  \item Construct a graph of this function. 
  \item Next to a few points on your graph, include the time $t$ at which the horse is at this point on the graph. Include an arrow for the horse's direction.

Notice in the problem above that we placed a vector symbol above the function name, as in $\vec r\colon {\mathbb{R}}^n\to {\mathbb{R}}^m$.  When the target space (codomain) is 2-dimensional or larger, we place a vector above the function name to remind us that the output is more than just a number.

Consider the pebble from problem \ref{pebble problem}. The pebble's height was given by $y=64-16t^2$.  The pebble also has some horizontal velocity (it's moving at 3 ft/s to the right).  If we let the origin be the base of the 64 ft building, then the position of the pebble at time $t$ is given by $\vec r(t) = (3t, 64-16t^2)$.
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item What are $n$ and $m$ when we write this function in the form  $\vec r\colon {\mathbb{R}}^n\to {\mathbb{R}}^m$?
  \item At what time does the pebble hit the ground (the height reaches zero)?  Construct a graph of the pebble's path from when it leaves the top of the building till when it hits the ground.

 A jet begins spiraling upwards to gain height. The position of the jet after $t$ seconds is modeled by the equation 
$\vec r(t)=(2\cos t, 2\sin t, t).$ We could alternatively write this as $x=2\cos t,\, y=2\sin t,\, z=t$. 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item What are $n$ and $m$ when we write this function in the form  $\vec r\colon {\mathbb{R}}^n\to {\mathbb{R}}^m$? 
 \item Construct a graph of this function by picking several values of $t$ and plotting the resulting points $(2\cos t, 2\sin t, t)$. 
 \item Next to a few points on your graph, include the time $t$ at which the jet is at this point on the graph. Include an arrow for the jet's direction.
 \item  How many dimensions do you need to graph this function?

In all the problems above, you should have noticed that in order to draw a function (provided you include arrows for direction, or use an animation to represent ``time''), you can determine how many dimensions you need to graph a function by just summing the dimensions of the domain and codomain. This is true in general.

  \item Compute the velocity and acceleration vectors at $t=\pi/2$. Place these vectors on your graph with their tails at the point corresponding to $t=\pi/2$.

We now increase the number of inputs from 1 to 2.  This will allow us to graph many space curves at the same time.

 The jet from problem \ref{jet intro for space curves} is actually accompanied by several jets flying side by side. As all the jets fly, they leave a smoke trail behind them (it's an air show). The smoke from one jet spreads outwards to mix with the neighboring jet, so that it looks like the jets are leaving a rather wide sheet of smoke behind them as they fly. The position of two of the many other jets is given by $\vec r_3(t)=(3\cos t, 3\sin t, t)$ and $\vec r_4(t)=(4\cos t,4\sin t,t)$.  A function which represents the smoke stream is $\vec r(a,t)=(a\cos t, a\sin t, t)$ for $0\leq t\leq 4\pi$ and $2\leq a\leq 4$.
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item What are $n$ and $m$ when we write the function $\vec r(a,t)=(a\cos t, a\sin t, t)$ in the form  $\vec r\colon {\mathbb{R}}^n\to {\mathbb{R}}^m$?
  \item Start by graphing the position of the three jets $\vec r(2,t)=(2\cos t, 2\sin t, t)$, $\vec r(3,t)=(3\cos t, 3\sin t, t)$ and $\vec r(4,t)=(4\cos t,4\sin t,t)$.  
  \item Let $t=0$ and graph the curve $r(a,0)=(a,0,0)$ for $a\in[2,4]$.  Then repeat this for $t=\pi/2,\pi,3\pi/2$.
  \item Describe the resulting surface.

The function above is called a parametric surface.  Parametric surfaces are formed by joining together many parametric space curves. Most of 3D computer animation is done using parametric surfaces. Woody's entire body in {\it Toy Story} is a collection of parametric surfaces. Car companies create computer models of vehicles using parametric surfaces, and then use those parametric surfaces to study collisions. Often the mathematics behind these models is hidden in the software program, but parametric surfaces are at the heart of just about every 3D computer model.

 Consider the parametric surface $\vec r(u,v)=(u\cos v, u\sin v, u^2)$ for $0\leq u\leq 3$ and $0\leq v\leq 2 \pi$.
 Construct a graph of this function. To do so, let $u$ equal a constant (such as 1, 2, 3) and then graph the resulting space curve.  Then let $v$ equal a constant (such as 0, $\pi/2$, etc.) and graph the resulting space curve until you can visualize the surface. [Hint: Think satellite dish.]

\section{Functions of Several Variables: $f\colon \RR^n \to \RR$}

In this section we'll focus on functions of the form $f\colon \mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^1$ and $f\colon \mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}^1$; we'll keep the output as a real number. In the next problem, you should notice that the input is a vector $(x,y)$ and the output is a number $z$. There are two ways to graph functions of this type.  The next two problems show you how.

 A computer chip has been disconnected from electricity and sitting in cold storage for quite some time.  The chip is connected to power, and a few moments later the temperature (in Celsius) at various points $(x,y)$ on the chip is measured. From these measurements, statistics is used to create a temperature function $z=f(x,y)$ to model the temperature at any point on the chip. Suppose that this chip's temperature function is given by the equation $z=f(x,y)=9-x^2-y^2$. We'll be creating a 3D model of this function in this problem, so you'll want to place all your graphs on the same $x,y,z$ axes.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item What is the temperature at $(0,0)$, $(1,2)$, and $(-4,3)$? \marginpar{\bmw{See 14.1: 1-4.}}
 \item If you let $y=0$, construct a graph of the temperature $z=f(x,0) = 9-x^2-0^2$, or just $z=9-x^2$. In the $xz$ plane (where $y=0$) draw this upside down parabola.
 \item Now let $x=0$. Draw the resulting parabola in the $yz$ plane.
 \item Now let $z=0$. Draw the resulting curve in the $xy$ plane.
 \item Once you've drawn a curve in each of the three coordinate planes, it's useful to pick an input variable (either $x$ or $y$) and let it equal various constants. So now let $x=1$ and draw the resulting parabola in the plane $x=1$.  Then repeat this for $x=2$.

The next function is of the form $w=f(x,y,z)$, so it has 3 inputs and 1 output.  We could write $f\colon \mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}^1$.

Most of our examples of function of the form $w=f(x,y,z)$ can be drawn by using our knowledge about conic sections. We can graph ellipses and hyperbolas if there are only two variables. So the key idea is to set one of the variables equal to a constant and then graph the resulting curve.  Repeat this with a few variables and a few constants, and you'll know what the surface is. Sometimes when you set a specific variable equal to a constant, you'll get an ellipse. If this occurs, try setting that variable equal to other constants, as ellipses are generally the easiest curves to draw.

\section{Vector Fields and Transformations: $\vec f\colon \RR^n\to\RR^n$}

We've covered the following types of functions in the problems above.
\begin{itemize}
 \item $y=f(x)$ or $f\colon \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ (functions of a single variable)
 \item $\vec r(t)=(x,y)$ or $f\colon \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^2$ (parametric curves)
 \item $\vec r(t)=(x,y,z)$ or $f\colon \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^3$ (space curves)
 \item $\vec r(u,v)=(x,y,z)$ or $f\colon \mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^3$ (parametric surfaces)
 \item $z=f(x,y)$ or $f\colon \mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$ (functions of two variables)
 \item $z=f(x,y,z)$ or $f\colon \mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}$ (functions of three variables)
\end{itemize}
This section We will consider functions from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$ and functions from $\mathbb{R}^3$ to $\mathbb{R}^3$.  Depending on the application, we may view these functions as either transformations of 2D or 3D space, or we may view them as vector fields in the plane or space.

A vector field $\vec F(x,y)=(M,N)$ is visualized by putting the vector $(M,N)$ at the point $(x,y)$, so you end up with a picture with a lot of vectors.  These are often used to visualize flows of air or liquids.  For example, see \href{http://ccom.unh.edu/vislab/projects/2d_flow_vis.html}{VisLab}, the \href{http://nowcoast.noaa.gov/}{NOAA visualizations},  \href{http://artsci.drake.edu/urness/research.html}{Tim Urness's research page}, or the \href{http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/scivis/}{International Visualization Challenge}.  There are also lots of other visualizations challenges.  Figuring out how to convey information in an asthetic and effective way is a tough challenge.

\subsection{Transformations}
\note{Make the transformations part a new chapter, along with the polar coordinate things they should know.}

Coordinate transformations let us view or discuss the plane or space in a different way.  A 2d transformation $\vec T(u,v)=(x,y)$ tells us how to transform a $(u,v)$ axes into an $(x,y)$ axes---the two outputs of $\vec T$ are considered the $x$ and $y$ coordinates corresponding to the inputs $u$ and $v$.

\begin{problem} \label{polar coordinate transformation graph}\marginpar{For this problem, you are just drawing many parametric curves.}%
\marginpar{Click \href{http://artsci.drake.edu/grout/mathbox/examples/polar.html}{here} or \href{http://artsci.drake.edu/grout/mathbox/examples/polar2.html}{here} for some help visualizing this transformation.}%
\larsonfive{\marginpar{See Larson 10.5.}}%
Consider the coordinate transformation $$\vec T(r,\theta) = (r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta).$$  In other words, according to $\vec T$, $x=r\cos\theta$ and $y=r\sin\theta$.  This is called the \emph{polar coordinate} transformation.  We will talk more about this transformation in the next chapter.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw two 2D axes, one having horizontal axis $r$ and vertical axis $\theta$, and the other axes having horizontal axis $x$ and vertical axis $y$.  In the next few parts, we'll see how $\vec T$ will tell us how points on the $(r,\theta)$ axes transform to points on the $(x,y)$ axes.
\item Plot the point $(r,\theta)=(1,\pi/2)$ on the $(r,\theta)$ axes.  According to $\vec T$, this point is transformed to what $(x,y)$ point?  Plot this corresponding point on the $(x,y)$ axes.
\item\marginpar{See \href{http://aleph.sagemath.org/?z=eJwtizEKwCAMAHdfETolkqG0s79wLyJCA62GmP_TwW53B5fR2O_mhRJarGPiMgaLU_pvFNSkO2wZLZ0EMjeGxUGLlbe5Sb30GY4rM6yVYWc4ogrRBx0PIJI=&lang=sage}{Sage} to check your answer.}  Plot the line segment $r=3$ (for $\theta\in [0,2\pi]$) on the $(r,\theta)$ axes.

 Plot the line segment $\theta=\pi/4$ (for $r\in[0,5]$) on the $(r,\theta)$ axes.  Plot the corresponding points on the $(x,y)$ axes by letting $\theta=\frac{\pi}{4}$ and then, on the same axes as above, add the graph of 
$\vec T\left(r,\frac{\pi}{4}\right)=\left(r\frac{\sqrt 2}{2},r \frac{\sqrt 2}{2}\right)$ for $r\in[0,5]$.
\item\marginpar{Use Sage to check your answer.} To the same axes as above, add the graphs of 
$\vec T(1,\theta), \vec T(2,\theta), \vec T(4,\theta)$  for $\theta\in[0,2\pi]$ and 
$\vec T(r,0), \vec T(r,\pi/2), \vec T(r,3\pi/4), \vec T(r,\pi)$ for $r\in[0,5]$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

In the previous problem, you saw how we can think of 2D transformations as mapping the points of one plane onto another.  Another way of thinking about transformations is to view them as giving additional coordinates to points on the plane, i.e., if $\vec T(u,v)=(x,y)$, then the point $(x,y)$ also can be called the point $(u,v)$ in the coordinate system associated with $\vec T$.  The next problem investigates this way of thinking about transformations.

\begin{problem}\larsonfive{\marginpar{See Larson 10.4.}}%
The transformation $\vec T(r,\theta) = (r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)$ is called the \emph{polar coordinate} transformation.  We will use this transformation to answer the following questions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\vec T(2,\pi/6)=(a,b)$.  What is $(a,b)$?  Draw the vector $(a,b)$, starting at the origin.
\item Show that the length of the vector $(a,b)$ is 2.  This is the ``radius'' of the point $(a,b)$.
\item Show that the angle between the positive $x$-axis and the vector $(a,b)$ is $\pi/6$. This angle is called the azimuth angle.
\item Show that if $\vec T(r,\theta)=(x,y)$, then the ``radius'' of the point $(x,y)$ is $r$.
\item Show that if $\vec T(r,\theta)=(x,y)$, then the azimuth angle of the vector $(x,y)$ is $\theta$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
  Sometimes a transformation may associate multiple coordinates with the same $(x,y)$ point on the plane.  In this problem, again use the polar coordinate transform $\vec T(r,\theta) = (r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)$.  Find 5 different $(r,\theta)$ so that $\vec T(r,\theta)=(\sqrt{3},1)$ (each of these is a different set of polar coordinates for the same point $(x,y)=(\sqrt{3},1)$).  Make at least one of your $(r,\theta)$ coordinates have a negative $r$, and at least one have a negative $\theta$.

 Let

  $Q=(x,y,0)$.  The angle between the ray $\vec{OQ}$ and the $x$-axis

There is some disagreement between different fields about the notation
for spherical coordinates.  In some fields (like physics), $\phi$
represents the azimuth angle and $\theta$ represents the inclination
angle.  In some fields, like geography, instead of the inclination angle, the
\emph{elevation} angle is given---the angle from the $xy$-plane (lines
of lattitude are from the elevation angle).
Additionally, sometimes the coordinates are written in a different
order.  You should always check the notation for spherical coordinates
before communicating using them.

If someone gives us parametric equations for a curve in the plane, we know how to draw the curve.  How do we obtain parametric equations of a given curve?

From those equations, we drew the path of the horse, and could have written a Cartesian equation for the path. How do we work this in reverse, namely if we had only been given the ellipse $\ds\frac{x^2}{4}+\frac{y^2}{9}=1$, could we have obtained parametric equations $\vec r(t)=(x(t),y(t))$ for the curve?

If someone gives us parametric equations for a surface, we can draw the surface. This is what we did in problems \ref{parametric surface example} and \ref{second parametric surface example}. 
How do we work backwards and obtain parametric equations for a given surface?
This requires that we write an equation for $x$, $y$, and $z$ in terms of two input variables (see \ref{parametric surface example} and \ref{second parametric surface example} for examples). 
In vector form, we need a function $\vec r\colon \mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^3$. 
We can often use a coordinate transformation $\vec T\colon \mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}^3$ to obtain a parametrization of a surface.

Sometimes you'll have to invent your own coordinate system when constructing parametric equations for a surface.  If you notice that there are lots of circles parallel to one of the coordinate planes, try using a modified version of cylindrical coordinates. Instead of circles in the $xy$ plane ($x=r\cos\theta,y=r\sin\theta,z=z$), maybe you need circles in the $yz$-plane ($x=x,y=r\cos\theta,z=r\sin\theta$) or the $xz$ plane.  Just look for lots of circles, and then construct your parametrization accordingly.
\begin{problem}
\larsonfive{\marginpar{See Larson 15.5:21--30.}}%
Find parametric equations for the surface $x^2+z^2=9$. [Hint: read the paragraph above.]  
\begin{enumerate}
 \item\marginpar{Use \href{http://aleph.sagemath.org}{Sage} or \href{http://www.wolframalpha.com/}{Wolfram Alpha} to plot each parametrization  (see \ref{3d parametric plot} for examples).}%
 What bounds should you use to obtain the portion of the surface between $y=-2$ and $y=3$?
 \item What bounds should you use to obtain the portion of the surface above $z=0$?
 \item What bounds should you use to obtain the portion of the surface with $x\geq 0$ and $y\in[2,5]$?
\end{enumerate}

\bmw{\begin{problem}
 Construct a graph of the surface $z = x^2-y^2$.  Do so in 2 ways.  (1) Construct a 3D surface plot.  (2) Construct a contour plot, which is a graph with several level curves. Which level curve passes through the point $(3,4)$? 
 Use Wolfram Alpha to know if you're right.  Just type ``plot z=x\^2-y\^2.''

\begin{problem}
Construct a plot of the vector field $$\vec F(x,y) = (x+y, -x+1)$$ by graphing the field at many integer points around the origin (I generally like to get the 8 integer points around the origin, and then a few more).
Then explain how to modify your graph to obtain a plot of the vector field $$\hat F(x,y) = \frac{(x+y, -x+1)}{\sqrt{(x+y)^2+(1-x)^2}}.$$
