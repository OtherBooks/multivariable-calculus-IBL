                    This unit covers the following ideas. In preparation
  for the quiz and exam, make sure you have a lesson plan
  containing examples that explain and illustrate the following
  concepts.

  <ol>
    <li>Describe how to integrate a function along a curve. Use
    line integrals to find the area of a sheet of metal with height
    $z=f(x,y)$ above a curve $\vec r(t)=\left(x,y\right)$ and the
    average value of a function along a curve.</li>

    <li>Find the following geometric properties of a curve:
    centroid, mass, center of mass, inertia, and radii of
    gyration.</li>

    <li class="vectorintegral">Compute the work (flow, circulation) and flux of a vector
    field along and across piecewise smooth curves.</li>

    <li class="vectorintegral">Determine if a field is a gradient field (hence
    conservative), and use the fundamental theorem of line
    integrals to simplify work calculations.</li>
  </ol>
        <p>You'll have a chance to teach your examples to your peers
  prior to the exam. <a href=
  "#line-integral-summary">This table</a> contains a summary of the
  key ideas for this chapter. <span class="bmw">Here are some extra

      After 3 semesters of trying this, I need to rewrite the
      section again. I put lots of notes in my notebook for this
      semester. I'll rewrite the section soon. Some problems need
      to be combined. Some need to be dropped. Other sections need
      more simpler problems (work/flux). Get rid of many of the
      &#8220;use a computer to integrate&#8221; problems. Just have
      them focus on what I'll ask them to do anyway. Do I need to
      focus on summation notation? I think it could be valuable to
      do so. Do I need to start with area, or would it be better to
      start with work. I'm thinking work might be a better way to
      start. Then I can put random work problems in the middle
      (just to beef up our abilities). Add flux midway through.
      Start with work. Then talk about area. Then talk about flux.
      Then talk about average value and center of mass. Leave out
      inertia for now (add it in later - this removes 5 problems,
      an entire day. They just have to be added later on, and the
      quizzes and exams have to be updated.) Then come back to
      work, and get to potentials. End with potentials and the
      fundamental theorem. Motivate everything with discussing the
      airflow along a wing. Does this cover it all? Problems 8.1
      and 8.2 have to be shrunk. They cannot be that long. They
      really are short, so make them short. Get rid of all the
      extra fluff, and put it later.

  <h1>Area</h1><div class="instructor">I draw and cut out the area between a
  curve and the axis on a sheet of paper and draw a representative
  rectangle on it. We talk about the single-variable way to find
  area and label the rectangle and label it with $f(x)$ and $dx$
  and $dA=f(x)dx$. Then I draw a curve on the whiteboard and put
  the $x$-axis of my sheet on the curve to show how we now are
  computing an area above a curve. Students see how the $dx$
  becomes $ds$, and how $d\sigma=f(x,y)ds$. Then we do the problem
  below and show the Sage graph.</div>
        <p>In first-semester calculus, we
  learned that the area under a function $f(x)$ above the $x$-axis
  is given by $A = \int_a^b f(x) dx$. The quantity $dA= f(x) dx$
  represents a small bit of area whose length is $dx$ and whose
  height is $f(x)$. To get the total area, we just added up the
  little bits of area, which is why $$A=\int dA = \int_a^b f(x)
  dx.$$ Now we want to generalize this</p>

  <div class="definition" label="Line Integral">
    <div class="marginpar">
      The line integral is also called the path integral, contour
      integral, or curve integral.
    </div>
      Let $f$ be a function and let $C$ be a piecewise smooth
    curve whose parametrization is $\vec r(t)$ for $t\in[a,b]$.
    We'll require that the composition $f(\vec r(t))$ be continuous
    for all $t\in [a,b]$. Then we define the line integral of $f$
    over $C$ to be the integral $$\int_C f ds = \int_a^b f(\vec
    r(t))\frac{ds}{dt}dt = \int_a^b f(\vec r(t))\left|\frac{d\vec
    r}{dt}\right|dt.$$

    When we ask you to set up a line integral, it means that you
    should do steps 1&dash;3, so that you get an integral with a single
    variable and with bounds that you could plug into a computer or
    complete by hand.
  </div>        <p>Notice that this definition suggests the following four
  steps. These four steps are the key to computing any line
  integral.</p>



  <ol>
    <li>Start by getting a parametrization $\vec r(t)$ for $a\leq
    t\leq b$ of the curve $C$.</li>

    r}{dt}$ and then the speed $\left|\dfrac{d\vec
    r}{dt}\right|$.</li>

    <li>Multiply $f$ by the speed, and replace each $x$, $y$,
    and/or $z$ with what it equals in terms of $t$.</li>

        The big idea behind integrals is that we are adding up a
  bunch of small quantities (above, it was $d\sigma=fds$) to get a
  total quantity (surface area). In line integrals, we add up the
  value of $f$ weighted by a length $ds=\abs{\frac{d\vec
  r}{dt}}dt$. This concept can be extended to curves that are more
  than just plane curves.

  <h1>Work, Flow, Circulation, and Flux</h1>
        <p>Let's turn our
  attention to the work done by a vector field representing a force
  as we move through the field. Work is a transfer of energy.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A tornado picks up a couch and applies forces to the couch
    as the couch swirls around the center. Work measures the
    transfer of energy from the tornado to the couch, giving the
    cough its kinetic energy.</li>

    <li>When an object falls, gravity does work on the object. The
    work done by gravity converts potential energy to kinetic
    energy.</li>

    <li>If we consider the flow of water down a river, it's gravity
    that gives the water its kinetic energy. We can place a
    hydroelectric dam next to river to capture a lot of this
    kinetic energy. Work transfers the kinetic energy of the river
    to rotational energy of the turbine, which eventually ends up
    as electrical energy available in our homes.</li>
  </ul>When we study work, we are really studying how energy is
  transferred. This is one of the key components of modern life.
  Let's start with simple review. Recall from Section~<a href=
  "#work-section">TODO</a> that the work done by a vector field
  $\vec F$ through a displacement $\vec d$ is the dot product $\vec
  F\cdot \vec d$.

  <div class="review*">
    An object moves from $A=(6,0)$ to $B=(0,3)$. Along the way, it
    encounters the constant force $\vec F = (2,5)$. How much work
    is done by $\vec F$ as the object moves from $A$ to $B$? See
    \footnote{The displacement is $B-A=(-6,3)$. The work is $\vec
    F\cdot \vec d = (2,5)\cdot(-6,3) = -12+15=3$.}.
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    An object moves from $A=(6,0)$ to $B=(0,3)$. A parametrization
    of the objects path is $\vec r(t) = (-6,3)t+(6,0)$ for $0\leq
    t\leq 1$.

    <ol>
      <li>For $0\leq t\leq .5$, the force encountered is $\vec F =
      (2,5)$. For $.5\leq t\leq 1$, the force encountered is
      $(2,6)$. How much work is done in the first half second? How
      much work is done in the last half second? How much total
      work is done?</li>

      <li>If we encounter a constant force $\vec F$ over a small
      displacement $d\vec r$, explain why the work done is \ $\ds
      dW = \vec F\cdot d\vec r =F\cdot \frac{d\vec r}{dt}dt $.</li>

      <li>
        <div class="marginpar">
          You can visualize what's happening in this problem as
          follows. A sailboat sails in a straight line between two
          points. As the sailboat moves through the water and the
          wind, the wind blows at the sailboat from different
          directions.

  on page \pageref{first work problem}, we made the following
  statements.

  <div class="quote">
    If a force $F$ acts through a displacement $d$, then the most
    basic definition of work is $W=Fd$, the product of the force
    and the displacement. This basic definition has a few
    assumptions.

    <ul>
      <li>The force $F$ must act in the same direction as the
      displacement.</li>

      <li>The force $F$ must be constant throughout the
      displacement.</li>

      <li>The displacement must be in a straight line.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>We used the dot product to remove the first assumption, and
  we showed in problem <a href="#first-work-problem">TODO</a>
  that the work is simply the dot product $$W=\vec F\cdot \vec r,$$
  where $\vec F$ is a force acting through a displacement $\vec r$.
  The previous problem showed that we can remove the assumption
  that $\vec F$ is constant, by integrating to obtain $$W=\int \vec
  F \cdot d\vec r = \int_a^b F\cdot \frac{d\vec r}{dt}dt, $$
  provided we have a parametrization of $\vec r$ with $a\leq t\leq
  b$. The next problem gets rid of the assumption that $\vec r$ is
  a straight line.

  </div>The examples above showed us that we can compute work along
  any closed curve. All we have to do is parametrize the curve,
  take a derivative, and then compute $dW = \vec F \cdot d\vec r$.
  This gives us a little bit of work along a curve, and we sum up
  the little bits of work (integrate) to find the total work. In
  the examples above, the vector fields represented forces.
  However, vector fields can represent much more than just forces.
  The vector field might represent the flow of water down a river,
  or the flow of air across an airplane wing. When we think of the
  vector field as a velocity field, a natural question is: how much
  of the fluid flows along our curve (the \emph{flow})?
  Alternately, we might ask how much of the fluid goes across our
  curve (the \emph{flux}). Flow along a curve is directly related
  to the lift of an airplane wing (which occurs when the flow along
  the top of the wing is different than the flow below the wing).
  The flux across a curve will quickly take us to powering a wind
  mill as wind flows across the surface of a blade (once we hit 3D
  integrals). Flux is also extremely important in studying electric
  and magnetic fields.

  Remember that work, flow, and circulation are $$W=\int_C (\vec
  F\cdot \vec T)ds =\int_C (M,N)\cdot(dx,dy) = \int_C Mdx+Ndy,$$
  while the formula for flux is $$\Phi=\int_C (\vec F\cdot \vec

  how these are both the line integral of a function $f = \vec
  F\cdot \vec T$ or $f=\vec F\cdot \vec n$ along a curve $C$. The
  function $f$ inside the integrand does not have to represent the
  height of a sheet. We'll use it to represent lots of things.

  <h1>Average Value</h1>
            
            <p>The concept of averaging values together
  has many applications. In first-semester calculus, we saw how to
  generalize the concept of averaging numbers together to get an
  average value of a function. We'll review both of these concepts.
  Later, we'll generalize average value to calculate centroids and
  center of mass.</p>

  <div class="problem" id="average-value-methods">
    <div class="instructor">Throughout the
    section, I point out how each formula is a variation on one of
    the patterns below.</div> 
      
      Suppose a class takes a test and there are
    three scores of 70, five scores of 85, one score of 90, and two
    scores of 95. We will calculate the average class score, $\bar
    s$, four different ways to emphasize four ways of thinking
    about the averages. We are emphasizing the pattern of the
    calculations in this problem, rather than the final answer, so
    it is important to write out each calculation completely in the
    form $\bar s = \blank{1cm}$ before calculating the number $\bar
    s$.

    <ol>
      <li>
        <div class="marginpar">
          $\bar s=\frac{\sum \text{values}}{\text{number of
          values}}$
        </div>Compute the average by adding 11 numbers together
        and dividing by the number of scores. Write down the whole
        computation before doing any arithmetic.
      </li>

      <li>
        <div class="marginpar">
          $\bar s=\frac{\sum (\text{value}\cdot\text{weight})}{\sum
          \text{weight}}$
        </div>Compute the numerator of the fraction in the
        previous part by multiplying each score by how many times
        it occurs, rather than adding it in the sum that many
        times. Again, write down the calculation for $\bar s$
        before doing any arithmetic.
      </li>

      <li>
        <div class="marginpar">
          $\bar s=\sum (\text{value}\cdot\text{(% of stuff)})$
        </div>Compute $\bar s$ by splitting up the fraction in
        the previous part into the sum of four numbers. This is
        called a &#8220;weighted average&#8221; because we are
        multiplying each score value by a weight.
      </li>

      <li>
        <div class="marginpar">
          $\text{(number of values)}\bar s = \sum \text{values}$<br/>
          $(\sum \text{weight})\bar s = \sum
          (\text{value}\cdot\text{weight})$
        </div>Another way of thinking about the average $\bar s$
        is that $\bar s$ is the number so that if all 11 scores
        were the same value $\bar s$, you'd have the same sum of
        scores. Write this way of thinking about these computations
        by taking the formulas for $\bar s$ in the first two parts
        and multiplying both sides by the denominator.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
            <p>In the next problem, we generalize the above ways of
  thinking about averages from a discrete situation to a continuous
  situation. You did this in first-semester calculus when you did
  average value using integrals.</p>

  <div class="problem">
    Suppose the price of a stock is \$10 for one day. Then the
    price of the stock jumps to $20 for two days. Our goal is to
    determine the average price of the stock over the three days.

    <ol>
      <li>Why is the average stock price not \$15?</li>

      <li>Let $f(t) = \begin{cases}10
      &amp;0&lt;t&lt;1\\20&amp;1&lt;t&lt;3\end{cases}$, the price
      of the stock for the three-day period. Draw the function $f$,
      and find the area under $f$ where $t\in[0,3]$.</li>

      <li>Now let $y=\bar f$. The area under $\bar f$ over $[0,3]$
      is simply width times height, or $(b-a)\bar f$. What should
      $\bar f$ equal so that the area under $\bar f$ over $[0,3]$
      matches the area under $f$ over $[0,3]$.</li>

      <li>We found a constant $\bar f$ so that the area under $\bar
      f$ matched the area under $f$. In other words, we solved the
      equation below for $\bar f$: $$\int_a^b \bar f dx = \int_a^b
      f dx$$ Solve for $\bar f$ symbolically (without doing any of
      the integrals). This quantity is called the average value of
      $f$ over $[a,b]$.</li>

      <li><div class="instructor">I also write $\bar f=\int_a^b f
      \frac{dx}{\int_a^b dx}$ to emphasize the weighted average
      approach</div>
          
          The formula for $\bar f$ in the previous part
      resembles at least one of the ways of calculating averages
      from <a href="#average-value-methods">the previous problem</a>.

    Let $C$ be a curve. If we look at all of the $x$-coordinates of
    the points on $C$, the &#8220;center&#8221; $x$-coordinate,
    $\bar x$, is the average of all these $x$-coordinates.
    Likewise, we can talk about the averages of all of the $y$
    coordinates or $z$ coordinates of points on the function ($\bar
    y$ or $\bar z$, respectively). The <em>centroid</em> of an object
    is the geometric center $(\bar x, \bar y, \bar z)$, the point
    with coordinates that are the average $x$, $y$, and $z$
    coordinates.

  <h1>Mass</h1>

  <div class="note">
    Jason made a comment that aluminum and copper won't combine. So
    this should be changed eventually.
  </div>Density is generally a mass per unit volume. However, when
  talking about a curve or wire, as in this chapter, it's simpler
  to let density be the mass per unit length. Sometimes an object
  is made out of a composite material, and the density of the
  object is different at different places in the object. For
  example, we might have a straight wire where one end is aluminum
  and the other end is copper. In the middle, the wire slowly
  transitions from being all aluminum to all copper. The centroid
  is the midpoint of the wire. However, since copper has a higher
  density than aluminum, the balance point (the center of mass)
  would not be at the midpoint of the wire, but would be closer to
  the denser and heavier copper end. In this section, we'll develop
  formulas for the mass and center of mass of such a wire.  <span class="bmw">In future mechanical

<div class="instructor">Here I introduce the center of mass of an

  formula is also an averaging of the coordinates, where the weight

  $xdm$).</div>

    Wikipedia has

  </div>
        
        The center of mass of an object is the point where the
  object balances. In order to calculate the $x$-coordinate of the
  center of mass, we average the $x$-coordinates, but we weight
  each $x$-coordinate with its mass. Similarly, we can calculate
  the $y$ and $z$ coordinates of the center of mass. The next
  problem helps us reason about the center of mass of a collection
  of objects. Calculating the center of mass of a collection of
  objects is important, for example, in astronomy when you want to
  calculate how two bodies orbit each other.

<div class="instructor">After a
    student presents, this is a great time to connect the averages

    I point out that we can think about the object as 2 points of
    the same mass at $P_1$ and 3 points of the same mass at $P_2$.
    This suggests averaging 5 things with method 1. Alternately, I
    suggest the approach $\frac{2}{5}P_1+\frac{3}{5}P_2$,
    suggesting a weighted average.</div>

      <li>Suppose now that we have a wire located along a curve
      $C$. The density of the wire is known to be $\delta(x,y,z)$
      (which could be different at different points on the curve).
      Imagine cutting the wire into a thousand or more tiny chunks.
      Each chunk would be centered at some point $(x_i,y_i,z_i)$
      and have length $ds_i$. Explain why the mass of each little
      chunk is $dm_i\approx\delta ds_i$.</li>

      <li>Give a formula for the center of mass in the $y$
      direction of the thousands of points $(x_i,y_i,z_i)$, each
      with mass $dm_i$. [This should almost be an exact copy of the
      first part.] Then explain why $$\bar y = \frac{\int_C y
      dm}{\int_C dm}=\frac{\int_C y \delta ds}{\int_C \delta
      ds}.$$</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
        
        <p>Ask me in class to show you another way to obtain the
  formula for center of mass. It involves looking at masses
  weighted by their distance (called a moment of mass). You may
  have already seen an idea similar to this in other classes, like
  statics (using moments of force) or statistics (in computing
  expected values). For quick reference, the formulas for the
  centroid of a wire along $C$ are $$ \bar x = \frac{\int_C x
  ds}{\int_C ds},\quad \bar y = \frac{\int_C y ds}{\int_C ds},\quad
  \text{and}\quad \bar z = \frac{\int_C z ds}{\int_C ds}.
  \quad\text{(Centroid)} $$ If the wire has density $\delta$, then
  the formulas for the center of mass are</p>

  <div class="marginpar">
    The quantity $\int_C x dm$ is sometimes called the first moment
    of mass about the $yz$-plane (so $x=0$). Notationally, some
    people write $M_{yz} =\int_C x ds$. Similarly, we could write
    $M_{xz}=\int_C y dm$ and $M_{xy}=\int_C zdm$. With this
    notation, we could write the center of mass formulas as $$(\bar
    x,\bar y,\bar z) = \left( \frac{M_{yz}}{m}, \frac{M_{xz}}{m},
    \frac{M_{xy}}{m} \right) . $$
  </div>
        <p>$$ \bar x = \frac{\int_C x dm}{\int_C dm},\quad \bar y =
  \frac{\int_C y dm}{\int_C dm},\quad \text{and}\quad \bar z =
  \frac{\int_C z dm}{\int_C dm}, \quad\text{(Center of mass)} $$
  where $dm=\delta ds$. Notice that the denominator in each case is
  just the mass $m=\int_C dm$. We'll often use the notation $(\bar
  x, \bar y,\bar z)$ to talk about both the centroid and the center
  of mass. If no density is given in a problem, then $(\bar x, \bar
  y,\bar z)$ is the centroid. If a density is provided, then $(\bar
  x, \bar y,\bar z)$ refers to the center of mass. If the density
  is constant, it doesn't matter (the centroid and center of mass
  are the same, which is what the seesaw problem showed).</p>

  <h1>The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals</h1>

  \emph{potential} function of the vector field. In this section,
  we'll first discuss finding the potential of such a vector field.
  Then we'll show that the work done by such a vector field is the

    </div>% Let $\vec F$ be a vector field. A potential for the
    vector field is a function $f$ whose derivative equals $\vec
    F$. So if $Df=\vec F$, then we say that $f$ is a potential for
    $\vec F$. When we want to emphasize that the derivative of $f$
    is a vector field, we call $Df$ the gradient of $f$ and write
    $Df = \vec \nabla f$.

    <div class="marginpar">
      The symbol $\vec \nabla f$ is read &#8220;the gradient of
      $f$&#8221; or &#8220;del f.&#8221;
    </div>If $\vec F$ has a potential, then we say that $\vec F$ is
    a gradient field.
  </div>We'll quickly see that if a vector field has a potential,
  then the work done by the vector field is the difference in the
  potential. If you've ever dealt with kinetic and potential
  energy, then you hopefully recall that the change in kinetic
  energy is precisely the difference in potential energy. This is
  the reason we use the word &#8220;potential.&#8221;

    Let $\vec F$ be a vector field that is everywhere continuously

  </div>If a vector field has a potential, then there is an
  extremely simple way to compute work. To see this, we must first
  review the fundamental theorem of calculus. The second half of
  the fundamental theorem of calculus states

  <div class="quote">
    If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $F$ is an anti-derivative
    of $f$, then $F(b)-F(a) = \int_a^b f(x) dx$.
  </div>If we replace $f$ with $f'$, then an anti-derivative of
  $f'$ is $f$, and we can write,

  <div class="quote">
    If $f$ is continuously differentiable on $[a,b]$, then
    $$f(b)-f(a)=\int_a^b f'(x) dx.$$

    </div>% Suppose $f$ is a continuously differentiable function,
    defined along some open region containing the smooth curve $C$.
    Let $\vec r(t)$ be a parametrization of the curve $C$ for
    $t\in[a,b]$. Then we have $$f(\vec r(b))-f(\vec r(a))=\int_a^b
    Df(\vec r(t))D\vec r(t)\ dt.$$
  </div>Notice that if $\vec F$ is a vector field, and has a
  potential $f$, which means $\vec F = Df$, then we could rephrase
  this theorem as follows.

  <div class="quote">
    Suppose $\vec F$ is a vector field that is continuous along
    some open region containing the curve $C$. Suppose $\vec F$ has
    a potential $f$. Let $A$ and $B$ be the start and end points of
    the smooth curve $C$. Then the work done by $\vec F$ along $C$
    depends only on the start and end points, and is precisely
    $$f(B)-f(A)=\int_C \vec F\cdot d\vec r = \int_C Mdx+Ndy.$$ The
    work done by $\vec F$ is the difference in a potential,
    $f(B)-f(A)$.
  </div>If you are familiar with kinetic energy, then you should
  notice a key idea here. Work is a transfer of energy. As an
  object falls, energy is transferred from potential energy to
  kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy at the end of a fall is
  precisely equal to the difference between the potential energy at
  the top of the fall and the potential energy at the bottom of the
  fall (neglecting air resistance). So work (the transfer of
  energy) is exactly the difference in potential energy.

    \label{fig:equivalences}
  </div>Let $\vec F=\langle M,N,P\rangle$ be continuous on an open
  set $D$. In the diagram in Figure~<a href=
  "#fig:equivalences">TODO</a>, the arrows represent implications
  (i.e., if there is an arrow from one statement pointing to
  another, then the first statement being true implies that the
  second statement is true). A label on the arrow means that the
  condition has to be satisfied for the implication to be hold. The
  definitions of the terms are in the book (or you can ask me).
  Using terms from the book, a &#8220;nice&#8221; set is a set that
  is open, connected, and simply connected. Roughly, this means
  that $D$ does not include its boundary and is a single region
  without any holes going through it. For such a &#8220;nice&#8221;
  set, all four statements in Figure~<a href=
  "#fig:equivalences">TODO</a> are equivalent (i.e., either they
  are all true or they are all false for a given vector field $\vec
  F$). If the set $D$ is not connected, then path-independence does
  not imply the vector field is a gradient field. In this case,
  discrepancies can occur between the two definitions for
  &#8220;conservative vector field&#8221;. There is a homework
  problem that shows that the bottom arrow does not hold when $D$
  is not simply connected. When $D$ is not connected and simply
  connected, we lose the nice, easy test in the lower left of the
  figure for determining exactly when a vector field is a gradient
  field.
