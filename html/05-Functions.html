        <h1>Functions</h1>
  This unit covers the following ideas. In preparation
  for the quiz and exam, make sure you have a lesson plan
  containing examples that explain and illustrate the following
  concepts.
  <ol>
    <li>Describe uses for, and construct graphs of, space curves
    and parametric surfaces. Find derivatives of space curves, and
    use this to find velocity, acceleration, and find equations of
    tangent lines.</li>

    <li>Describe uses for, and construct graphs of, functions of
    several variables. For functions of the form $z=f(x,y)$, this
    includes both 3D surface plots and 2D level curve plots. For
    functions of the form $w=f(x,y,z)$, construct plots of level
    surfaces.</li>

    <li>Describe uses for, and construct graphs of, vector fields
    and transformations.</li>

    <li>If you are given a description of a vector field, curve, or
    surface (instead of a function or parametrization), explain how
    to obtain a function for the vector field, or a parametrization
    for the curve or surface.</li>
  </ol>You'll have a chance to teach your examples to your peers
  prior to the exam.

  <h1>Function Terminology</h1>
    
    <p>A function is a set of instructions
  involving two sets (called the domain and codomain). A function
  assigns to each element of the domain $D$ exactly one element in
  the codomain $R$. We'll often refer to the codomain $R$ as the
  target space or range. We'll write $$f\colon D\to R$$ when we want to
  be explicit about the domain and range of $f$. </p>
<p>In this class,
  we will study what happens when the domain and target space are
  subsets of ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ (Euclidean $n$-space). In particular,
  we will study functions of the form $$f\colon {\mathbb{R}}^n\to
  {\mathbb{R}}^m,$$ when $m$ and $n$ are 3 or less. The number
  $n$ is the dimension of the input vector (or number of inputs).
  The number $m$ is the dimension of the output vector (or number
  of outputs). Our goal is to understand uses for each type of
  function and be able to construct graphs to represent the
  function. We will focus most of our time this semester on two-
  and three-dimensional problems. However, many problems in the
  real world require a higher number of dimensions. </p>
    <p>When you hear
  the word &ldquo;dimension&rdquo;, it does not always
  represent a physical dimension, such as length, width, or height.
  If a quantity depends on 30 different measurements, then the
  problem involves 30 dimensions. As a quick illustration, the
  formula for the distance between two points depends on 6 numbers,
  so distance is really a 6-dimensional problem. As another
  example, if a piece of equipment has a color, temperature, age,
  and cost, we can think of that piece of equipment being
  represented by a point in four-dimensional space (where the
  coordinate axes represent color, temperature, age, and cost).</p>

      A jet begins spiraling upwards to gain height. The
    position of the jet after $t$ seconds is modeled by the

    <p>A key general principle in the problems above (and from our discussion in class) is that to fully represent a function visually, you need to use as many dimensions as the sum of the dimension of the domain and the dimension of the codomain.

      The jet from <a href=
    "#jet-intro-for-space-curves">the problem above</a> is actually
    accompanied by several jets flying side by side. As all the
    jets fly, they leave a smoke trail behind them. The smoke from one jet spreads outwards to mix with the
    neighboring jet, so that it looks like the jets are leaving a
    rather wide sheet of smoke behind them as they fly. The
    position of two of the many other jets is given by $\vec
    r_3(t)=(3\cos t, 3\sin t, t)$ and $\vec r_4(t)=(4\cos t,4\sin
    t,t)$. A function which represents the smoke stream is $\vec

      A computer chip has been disconnected from electricity
    and sitting in cold storage for quite some time. The chip is
    connected to power, and a few moments later the temperature (in
    Celsius) at various points $(x,y)$ on the chip is measured.
    From these measurements, statistics is used to create a
    temperature function $z=f(x,y)$ to model the temperature at any
    point on the chip. Suppose that this chip's temperature
    function is given by the equation $z=f(x,y)=9-x^2-y^2$. We'll
    be creating a 3D model of this function in this problem, so
    you'll want to place all your graphs on the same $x,y,z$ axes.

    <ol>
      <li>What is the temperature at $(0,0)$, $(1,2)$, and
      $(-4,3)$?

        <span class="marginpar bmw">See 14.1: 1-4.</span>
      </li>

      <li>If you let $y=0$, construct a graph of the temperature
      $z=f(x,0) = 9-x^2-0^2$, or just $z=9-x^2$. In the $xz$ plane
      (where $y=0$) draw this upside down parabola.</li>

      <li>Now let $x=0$. Draw the resulting parabola in the $yz$
      plane.</li>

      <li>Now let $z=0$. Draw the resulting curve in the $xy$
      plane.</li>

      <li>Once you've drawn a curve in each of the three coordinate
      planes, it's useful to pick an input variable (either $x$ or
      $y$) and let it equal various constants. So now let $x=1$ and
      draw the resulting parabola in the plane $x=1$. Then repeat
      this for $x=2$.</li>

      <li>Describe the shape. Add any extra features to your graph

    temperature is constant. We'll create a graph in 2D of the

        Which points in the plane have zero temperature?
        Just let $z=0$ in $z=9-x^2-y^2$. Plot the corresponding
        points in the $xy$-plane, and write $z=0$ next to this
        curve. This curve is called a level curve. As long as you
        stay on this curve, your temperature will remain level, it
        will not increase nor decrease.

      <li>Which points in the plane have temperature $z=5$? Add
      this level curve to your 2D plot and write $z=5$ next to

      Consider the function $f(x,y)=x-y^2$.

      the curves given by $x=0$ and $y=0$ and then try setting $x$
      or $y$ equal to some other constants, like $x=1$, $x=2$,
      $y=1$, $y=2$, etc.]</li>

      <li>Construct a contour plot of $f$. [So just graph in 2D the
      curves given by setting $z$ equal to a few constants, like
      $z=0$, $z=1$, $z=-4$, etc.]</li>

  <p>Notice that when we graphed the previous two functions (of
  the form $z=f(x,y)$) we could either construct a 3D surface plot,
  or we could reduce the dimension by 1 and construct a 2D contour
  plot by letting the output $z$ equal various constants. The next
  function is of the form $w=f(x,y,z)$, so it has 3 inputs and 1
  output. We could write $f\colon \mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}^1$. We
  would need 4 dimensions to graph this function, but graphing in
  4D is not an easy task. Instead, we'll reduce the dimension and
  create plots in 3D to describe the level surfaces of the

  <p>Most of our examples of function of the form $w=f(x,y,z)$
  can be drawn by using our knowledge about conic sections. We can
  graph ellipses and hyperbolas if there are only two variables. So
  the key idea is to set one of the variables equal to a constant
  and then graph the resulting curve. Repeat this with a few
  variables and a few constants, and you'll know what the surface
  is. Sometimes when you set a specific variable equal to a
  constant, you'll get an ellipse. If this occurs, try setting that

  the point $(u,v)$ in the coordinate system associated with $\vec

  the notation for spherical coordinates. In some fields (like
  physics), $\phi$ represents the azimuth angle and $\theta$
  represents the inclination angle. In some fields, like geography,
  instead of the inclination angle, the \emph{elevation} angle is
  given&mdash;the angle from the $xy$-plane (lines of lattitude are
  from the elevation angle). Additionally, sometimes the
  coordinates are written in a different order. You should always
  check the notation for spherical coordinates before communicating
