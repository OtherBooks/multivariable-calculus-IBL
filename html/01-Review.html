  <h1>Review of First Semester Calculus</h1>
<section>
  <h1>Graphing</h1>
  <p>We'll need to know how to graph by hand some
  basic functions. If you have not spent much time graphing
  functions by hand before this class, then you should spend some
  time graphing the following functions by hand. When we start
  drawing functions in 3D, we'll have to piece together infinitely
  many 2D graphs. Knowing the basic shape of graphs will help us do
  this.</p>

  <div class="problem">
    Provide a rough sketch of the following functions, showing
    their basic shapes: $$\displaystyle x^2, x^3, x^4, \frac{1}{x},
    \sin x, \cos x, \tan x, \sec x, \arctan x, e^x,\ln x.$$ Then
    use a computer algebra system, such as
    <a href="http://sagecell.sagemath.org">Sage</a> or <a href="http://http://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha</a> to
    verify your work.
  </div>

</section><section>  <h1>Derivatives</h1>

  <p>In first semester calculus, one of the things
  you focused on was learning to compute derivatives. You'll need
  to know the derivatives of basic functions (found on the end
  cover of almost every calculus textbook). Computing derivatives
  accurately and rapidly will make learning calculus in high
  dimensions easier. The following rules are crucial.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Power rule {$(x^n)' = nx^{n-1}$}</li>

    <li>Sum and difference rule {$(f\pm g) = f'\pm g'$}</li>

    <li>Product {$(fg)' = f' g + fg'$} and quotient rule
    {$\ds\left(\frac f g\right)' = \frac{f' g - fg'}{g^2}$}</li>

    <li>Chain rule (arguably the most important) {$(f\circ g)' =
    f'(g(x))\cdot g'(x)$}</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="problem">
    <div class="marginpar bmw">See sections 3.2-3.6 for more practice with derivatives.
      The later problems in 3.6 review of most of the entire
      differentiation chapter.</div>
      Compute the derivative of $e^{\sec
    x}\cos(\tan(x)+\ln(x^2+4))$. Show each step in your
    computation, making sure to show what rules you used.
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    If $y(p) = \ds \frac{e^{p^3}\cot(4p+7)}{\tan^{-1}(p^4)}$ find
    $dy/dp$. Again, show each step in your computation, making sure
    to show what rules you used.
  </div>

  <p>The following problem will help you review some of your
  trigonometry, inverse functions, as well as implicit
  differentiation.</p>

  <div class="problem">
    <div class="marginpar bmw">
      See sections 3.7-3.9 for more examples involving inverse
      trig functions and implicit differentiation.</div>
      Use implicit differentiation to explain why the
    derivative of $y=\arcsin x$ is $\ds y'=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$.
    [Rewrite $y=\arcsin x$ as $x=\sin y$, differentiate both sides,
    solve for $y'$, and then write the answer in terms of $x$].
  </div>

  </section>
  <section>
  <h1>Integrals</h1>
  <p>Each derivative rule from the front cover of
  your calculus text is also an integration rule. In addition to
  these basic rules, we'll need to know three integration
  techniques. They are (1) $u$-substitution, (2)
  integration-by-parts, and (3) integration by using software.
  There are many other integration techniques, but we will not
  focus on them. If you are trying to compute an integral to get a
  number while on the job, then software will almost always be the
  tool you use. As we develop new ideas in this and future classes
  (in engineering, physics, statistics, math), you'll find that
  $u$-substitution and integrations-by-parts show up so frequently
  that knowing when and how to apply them becomes crucial.</p>

  <div class="problem">
    <div class="marginpar bmw">
      For practice with $u$-substitution, see section 5.5 and
      5.6. \\ For practice with integration by parts, see section
      8.1.</div>
      Compute $\ds\int x\sqrt{x^2+4}dx$.
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    Compute $\ds\int x\sin 2x dx$.
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    Compute $\ds \int \arctan x dx$.
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    Compute $\ds \int x^2 e^{3x} dx$.
  </div>

</section></section><section>
  <h1>Differentials</h1>
  <p>The derivative of a function gives us the
  slope of a tangent line to that function. We can use this tangent
  line to estimate how much the output ($y$ values) will change if
  we change the input ($x$-value). If we rewrite the notation
  $\ds\frac{dy}{dx}=f'$ in the form $dy=f' dx$, then we can read
  this as &ldquo;A small change in $y$ (called $dy$) equals the
  derivative ($f'$) times a small change in $x$ (called $dx$).&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="definition">
    We call $dx$ the differential of $x$. If $f$ is a function of
    $x$, then the differential of $f$ is $df = f'(x) dx$. Since we
    often write $y=f(x)$, we'll interchangeably use $dy$ and $df$
    to represent the differential of $f$. We will often refer to
    the differential notation $dy=f'dx$ as <q>a change in the output
    $y$ equals the derivative times a change in the input $x$.</q>
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <div class="marginpar bmw"> See 3.10:19-38.</div>

    If $f(x) = x^2\ln(3x+2)$ and $g(t) = e^{2t}\tan(t^2)$
    then compute $df$ and $dg$.
  </div>

  <p>Most of higher dimensional calculus can quickly be
  developed from differential notation. Once we have the language
  of vectors and matrices at our command, we will develop calculus
  in higher dimensions by writing $d\vec y = Df(\vec x) d\vec x$.
  Variables will become vectors, and the derivative will become a
  matrix. This problem will help you see how the notion of
  differentials is used to develop equations of tangent lines.
  We'll use this same idea to develop tangent planes to surfaces in
  3D and more.</p>

  <div class="problem" id="differentials-give-tangent-lines">

    <div class="marginpar">
      <span class="bmw">See 3.11:39-44. Also see problems 3.11:1-18.</span> The
      linearization of a function is just an equation of the
      tangent line where you solve for $y$.
    </div>

    Consider the function $y=f(x) = x^2$. This problem has
    multiple steps, but each is fairly short.

    <ol>
      <li>Find the differential of $y$ with respect to $x$.</li>

      <li>Give an equation of the tangent line to $f(x)$ at
      $x=3$.</li>

      <li>Draw a graph of $f(x)$ and the tangent line on the same
      axes. Place a dot at the point $(3,9)$ and label it on your
      graph. Place another dot on the tangent line up and to the
      right of (3,9). Label the point $(x,y)$, as it will represent
      any point on the tangent line.</li>

      <li>Using the two points $(3,9)$ and $(x,y)$, compute the
      slope of the line connecting these two points. Your answer
      should involve $x$ and $y$. What is the rise (i.e, the change
      in $y$ called $dy$)? What is the run (i.e, the change in $x$
      called $dx$)?</li>

      <li>We already know the slope of the tangent line is the
      derivative $f'(3)=6$. We also know the slope from the
      previous part. These two must be equal. Use this fact to give
      an equation of the tangent line to $f(x)$ at $x=3$.</li>
    </ol>

  <div class="problem" id="diff-sphere">
    <div class="marginpar bmw">See 3.11:45-62.</div>
    The manufacturer of a spherical
    storage tank needs to create a tank with a radius of 3 meters.
    Recall that the volume of a sphere is $V(r) = \frac{4}{3}\pi
    r^3$. No manufacturing process is perfect, so the resulting
    sphere will have a radius of 3 meters, plus or minus some small
    amount $dr$. The actual radius will be $3+dr$. Find the
    differential $dV$. Then use differentials to estimate the
    change in the volume of the sphere if the actual radius is 3.02
    meters instead of the planned 3 meters.
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    A forest ranger needs to estimate the height of a tree. The
    ranger stands 50 feet from the base of tree and measures the
    angle of elevation to the top of the tree to be about
    60$^\circ$. If this angle of 60$^\circ$ is correct, then what
    is the height of the tree? If the ranger's angle measurement
    could be off by as much as $5^\circ$, then how much could his
    estimate of the height be off? Use differentials to give an
    answer.
  </div>

</section>
  <section><h1 id="review-matrices">Matrices</h1>
  <p>We will soon discover
  that matrices represent derivatives in high dimensions. When you
  use matrices to represent derivatives, the chain rule is
  precisely matrix multiplication. For now, we just need to become
  comfortable with matrix multiplication. We perform matrix
  multiplication &ldquo;row by column&rdquo;. Wikipedia has an excellent
  visual illustration of how to do this. See
  <span class="marginpar">Click on the links to go to the websites.</span>

<section>  <h1>Determinants</h1>

  <p>Associated with every square matrix is a number, called the
  <em>determinant</em>, which is related to length, area, and volume.
  We'll use the determinant to generalize the concept of volume to
  higher dimensions as well.  Determinants will appear as we study
  cross products and when we get to the high dimensional version of
  $u$-substitution. Determinants are only defined for square
  matrices.</p>

  <div class="definition">
    The determinant of a $2\times 2$ matrix is the number

    <span class="marginpar">
      We use vertical bars next to a matrix to state we want the
      determinant, so $\det A = |A|$.

    <span class="marginpar">
      Notice the negative sign on the middle term of the $3 \times
      3$ determinant. Also, notice that we had to compute three
      determinants of 2 by 2 matrices in order to find the
      determinant of a 3 by 3 matrix.

    <div class="marginpar">
      For extra practice, create your own square matrix (2 by 2 or
      3 by 3) and compute the determinant by hand. Then use Sage or Wolfram
      Alpha to check your work. Do this until you feel comfortable
      taking determinants.

  <p>What good is the determinant? The determinant was
  discovered as a result of trying to find the area of a
  parallelogram and the volume of the three dimensional version of
  a parallelogram (called a parallelepiped) in space. If we had a
  full semester to spend on linear algebra, we could eventually
  prove the following facts that I will just present here with a
  few examples.</p>


  <p>Consider the 2 by 2 matrix $\begin{bmatrix}3&1\\0&2\end{bmatrix}$ whose determinant is $3\cdot 2-0\cdot 1=6$. Draw the column vectors $\begin{bmatrix}3\\0\end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\end{bmatrix}$ with their base at the origin (see figure \ref{detfig}). 
These two vectors give the edges of a parallelogram whose area is the
  determinant $6$.  If I swap the order of the two vectors in the
  matrix, then the determinant of
  $\begin{bmatrix}1&3\\2&0\end{bmatrix}$ is $-6$.  The reason for the
  difference is that the determinant not only keeps track of area, but
  also order. Starting at the first vector, if you can turn
  counterclockwise through an angle smaller than 180$^\circ$ to obtain
  the second vector, then the determinant is positive.  If you have to
  turn clockwise instead, then the determinant is negative.  This is
  often termed &ldquo;the right-hand rule&rdquo; since rotating the fingers of
  your right hand from the first vector to the second vector will
  cause your thumb to point up precisely when the determinant is
  positive.

    </div>\caption{The determinant gives both area and direction. A
    counter clockwise rotation from column 1 to column 2 gives a
    positive determinant.\label{detfig}}
  </div>% }}
  </div>

<p>For a 3 by 3 matrix, the columns give the edges of a three dimensional parallelepiped and the determinant produces the volume of this object. The sign of the determinant is related to orientation. If you can use your right hand and place your index finger on the first vector, middle finger on the second vector, and thumb on the third vector, then the determinant is positive. 
For example, consider the matrix $A = \begin{bmatrix}\cl{1\\0\\0}&\cl{0\\2\\0}&\cl{0\\0\\3}\end{bmatrix}$.  Starting from the origin, each column represents an edge of the rectangular box 
$0\leq x\leq 1$, 
$0\leq y\leq 2$, 
$0\leq z\leq 3$ with volume (and determinant) $V=lwh=(1)(2)(3)=6$. The sign of the determinant is positive because if you place your index finger pointing in the direction (1,0,0) and your middle finger in the direction (0,2,0), then your thumb points upwards in the direction (0,0,3). 
If you interchange two of the columns, for example 
$B = \begin{bmatrix} \cl{0\\2\\0}&\cl{1\\0\\0}&\cl{0\\0\\3}\end{bmatrix}$, then the volume doesn't change since the shape is still the same. However, the sign of the determinant is negative because if you point your index finger in the direction (0,2,0) and your middle finger in the direction (1,0,0), then your thumb points down in the direction (0,0,-3). If you repeat this with your left hand instead of right hand, then your thumb points up.</p>

  <h1>Higher Order Approximations</h1>
  <p>When you ask a calculator to
  tell you what $e^{0.1}$ means, your calculator uses an extension
  of differentials to give you an approximation. The calculator
  only uses polynomials (multiplication and addition) to give you
  an answer. This same process is used to evaluate any function
  that is not a polynomial (so trig functions, square roots,
  inverse trig functions, logarithms, etc.) The key idea needed to
  approximate functions is illustrated by the next problem.</p>

  <div class="problem">
    Let $f(x)=e^x$. You should find that your work on each step can
    be reused to do the next step.

    <ul>
      <li>Find a first degree polynomial $P_1(x)=a+bx$ so that
      $P_1(0)=f(0)$ and $P'_1(0)=f'(0)$. In other words, give me a
      line that passes through the same point and has the same
      slope as $f(x)=e^x$ does at $x=0$. Set up a system of
      equations and then find the unknowns $a$ and $b$. The next
      two are very similar.</li>

      <li>Find a second degree polynomial $P_2(x)=a+bx+cx^2$ so
      that $P_2(0)=f(0)$, $P'_2(0)=f'(0)$, and $P''_2(0)=f''(0)$.
      In other words, give me a parabola that passes through the
      same point, has the same slope, and has the same concavity as
      $f(x)=e^x$ does at $x=0$.</li>

      <li>Find a third degree polynomial $P_3(x)=a+bx+cx^2+dx^3$ so
      that $P_3(0)=f(0)$, $P'_3(0)=f'(0)$, $P''_3(0)=f''(0)$, and
      $P'''_3(0)=f'''(0)$. In other words, give me a cubic that
      passes through the same point, has the same slope, the same
      concavity, and the same third derivative as $f(x)=e^x$ does
      at $x=0$.</li>

      <li>Now compute $e^{0.1}$ with a calculator. Then compute
      $P_1(.1)$, $P_2(.1)$, and $P_3(.1)$. How accurate are the
      line, parabola, and cubic in approximating $e^{.1}$?</li>

  <div class="marginpar"> The polynomial you are

    Now let $f(x)=\sin x$. Find a 7th degree polynomial so
    that the function and the polynomial have the same value and
    same first seven derivatives when evaluated at $x=0$. Evaluate
    the polynomial at $x=0.3$. How close is this value to your
    calculator's estimate of $\sin(0.3)$? You may find it valuable
    to use the notation $$P(x) = a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3 +\cdots+a_7
    x^7.$$

  <p>The previous two problems involved finding polynomial
  approximations to the function at $x=0$. The next problem shows
  how to move this to any other point, such as $x=1$.</p>

  <div class="comment">
    The problems above introduced the final idea. We will let
    $dx=x-c$ (a small change in $x$). Since the polynomial should be
    close to the function, a small change in $y$ is $dy=P_n(x)-f(c)$.
    We can write the Taylor polynomial notation above in the form 
    $$P_n(x) -
    f(c)=dy=\frac{f'(c)}{1!}dx+\frac{f''(c)}{2!}dx^2+\cdots
    +\frac{f^{(n)}(c)}{n!}dx^n. $$  If we want to estimate the
    change in $y$ using a first order approximation, this gives us
    the differential notation  $$dy = f'(c)dx.$$  A second order
    approximation is  $$dy = f'(c)dx + \frac{f''(c)}{2!}dx^2.$$  A
    third order approximation is $$dy = f'(c)dx +
    \frac{f''(c)}{2!}dx^2+ \frac{f'''(c)}{3!}dx^3.$$

  <div class="example">
<p>    This example refers back to <a href="#diff-sphere">this problem above</a>. We
    wanted a spherical tank of radius 3m, but due to manufacturing
    error the radius was slightly off. Let's now illustrate how we
    can use polynomials to give a first, second, and third order
    approximation of the volume if the radius is 3.02m instead of
    3m. We start with $V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$ and then compute the
    derivatives $$V'=4\pi r^2, V''=8\pi r, \text{ and }
    V'''=8\pi.$$ Because we are approximating the increase in
    volume from $r=3$ to something new, we'll create our polynomial
    approximations centered at $r=3$. We'll consider the polynomial
    $$P(r)=a_0+a_1(r-3)+a_2(r-3)^2+a_3(r-3)^3,$$ whose derivatives
    are $$P'=a_1+2a_2(r-3)+3a_3(r-3)^2, P''=2a_2+6a_3(r-3),
    P'''=6a_3.$$ So that the derivatives of the volume function
    match the derivatives of the polynomial (at $r=3$), we need to
    satisfy the equations in the table below.</p>

    <table>
<tr><th> $k$ </th><th> Value of $V$ at the $k$th derivative </th><th> Value of $P$ at the $k$th derivative </th><th> Equation</th></tr>
<tr><td>  $0$ </td><td> $V(3) = \frac{4}{3}\pi (3)^3 = 36\pi$ </td><td> $P(3) = a_0$ </td><td> $a_0=36\pi$ </td></tr>
<tr><td> $1$ </td><td> $V'(3) = 4\pi (3)^2=36\pi$ </td><td> $P'(3) = a_1$ </td><td> $a_1=36\pi$ </td></tr>
<tr><td> $2$ </td><td> $V''(3) = 8\pi (3)=24\pi$ </td><td> $P''(3) = 2a_2$ </td><td> $2a_2=24\pi$ </td></tr>
<tr><td> $3$ </td><td> $V'''(3) = 8\pi$ </td><td> $P'''(3) = 6a_3$ </td><td> $6a_3=8\pi$ </td></tr>
        </table>  

<p>This tells us that the third order polynomial is
    $$P(r)=a_0+a_1(r-3)+a_2(r-3)^2+a_3(r-3)^3
    =36\pi+36\pi(r-3)+12\pi(r-3)^2+\frac{4}{3}\pi(r-3)^3 .$$ We
    wanted to approximate the volume if $r=3.2$, so our change in
    $r$ is $dr=3.2-3=0.2$. We can rewrite our polynomial as
    $$P(r)=36\pi+36\pi(dr)+12\pi(dr)^2+\frac{4}{3}\pi(dr)^3.$$ We
    are now prepared to approximate the volume using a first,
    second, and third order approximation.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>A first order approximation yields $P=36\pi+ 36\pi\cdot
      0.02 =36.72\pi.$ The volume increased by $0.72\pi$
      m$^3$.</li>

      <li>A second order approximation yields $$P=36\pi+ 36\pi\cdot
      0.02 +12\pi (0.02)^2 =36.7248\pi.$$</li>

      <li>A third order approximation yields $$P=36\pi+36\pi\cdot
      0.02 +12\pi (0.02)^2+\frac{4}{3}\pi(0.02)^3
      =36.724810\bar6\pi.$$</li>
    </ol>

    <p>With each approximation, we add on a little more volume to
    get closer to the actual volume of a sphere with radius
    $r=3.02$. The actual volume of a sphere involves a cubic
    function, so when we approximate the volume with a cubic, we
    should get an exact approximation (and $ V(3.02) = \frac 43 \pi
    (3.02)^3 =(36.724810\bar6)\pi$.)</p>
  </div>

  <p>We'll end this section with a problem to practice the
  example above.</p>

  <div class="problem">
    <div class="marginpar">
      Ask me in class to draw a 3D graph which illustrates the
      volume added on by each successive approximation. As a
      challenge, try to construct this graph yourself first. If you
      have it before I put it up in class, let me know and I'll let
      you share what you have discovered with the class.

    Suppose you are constructing a cube whose side length should be
    $s=2$ units. The manufacturing process is not exact, but
    instead creates a cube with side lengths $s=2+ds$ units. (You
    should assume that all sides are still the same, so any error
    on one side is replicated on all. We have to assume this for
    now, but before the semester ends we'll be able to do this with
    high dimensional calculus.)

    <p>Suppose that the machine creates a cube with side length
    $2.3$ units instead of 2 units. Note that the volume of the
    cube is $V=s^3$. Use a first, second, and third order
    approximation to estimate the increase in volume caused by the
    .3 increase in side length. Then compute the actual increase in
    volume $V(2.3)-V(2)$.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    I would include this problem above in class as a demonstration.
    It allows them to see what differentials do. You can easily see
    how each new piece adds more to the approximation.
