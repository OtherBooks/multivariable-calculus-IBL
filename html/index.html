<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>This course may be like no other course in mathematics you have ever taken.  We'll discuss in class some of the key differences, and eventually this section will contain a complete description of how this course works. For now, it's just a skeleton.</p>

<p>I received the following email about 6 months after a student took the course:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey Brother Woodruff,</p>

<p>I was reading <em>Knowledge of Spiritual Things</em> by Elder Scott.
I thought the following quote would be awesome to share with your
students, especially those in Math 215 :)</p>

<blockquote>
Profound [spiritual] truth cannot simply be poured
from one mind and heart to another. It takes faith
and diligent effort. Precious truth comes a small
piece at a time through faith, with great exertion,
and at times wrenching struggles.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Elder Scott's words perfectly describe how we acquire mathematical truth, as well as spiritual truth.</p>
