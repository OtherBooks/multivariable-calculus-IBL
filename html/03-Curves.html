  concepts.

    foci for conic sections (parabolas, ellipses, hyperbolas).</li>

    curves.</li>
  </ol>You'll have a chance to teach your examples to your peers
  prior to the exam.

  <section><h1>Conic Sections</h1>
  <p>Before we jump fully into $\mathbb{R}^3$,
  we need some good examples of planar curves (curves in
  $\mathbb{R}^2$) that we'll extend to object in 3D. These examples
  are conic sections. We call them conic sections because you can
  obtain each one by intersecting a cone and a plane (I'll show you
  in class how to do this). Here's a definition.</p>

  <div class="definition">
    Consider two identical, infinitely tall, right circular cones
    placed vertex to vertex so that they share the same axis of
    symmetry. A conic section is the intersection of this three
    dimensional surface with any plane that does not pass through
    the vertex where the two cones meet.
  </div>

  <p>These intersections are called circles (when the plane is
  perpendicular to the axis of symmetry), parabolas (when the plane
  is parallel to one side of one cone), hyperbolas (when the plane
  is parallel to the axis of symmetry), and ellipses (when the
  plane does not meet any of the three previous criteria). The
  definition above provides a geometric description of how to
  obtain a conic section from cone. We'll not introduce an
  alternate definition based on distances between points and lines,
  or between points and points. Let's start with one you are
  familiar with.</p>

  <div class="definition">
    Consider the point $P=(a,b)$ and a positive number $r.$ A
    circle circle with center $(a,b)$ and radius $r$ is the set of
    all points $Q=(x,y)$ in the plane so that the segment $PQ$ has
    length $r$.
  </div>

  <p>Using the distance formula, this means that every circle
  can be written in the form $(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=r^2$.
  </p>
  
  <div class="problem">
    The equation $4x^2+4y^2+6x-8y-1=0$ represents a circle (though
    initially it does not look like it). Use the method of
    completing the square to rewrite the equation in the form
    $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$ (hence telling you the center and
    radius). Then generalize your work to find the center and
    radius of any circle written in the form $x^2+y^2+Dx+Ey+F=0$.
  </div>

  <section><h1>Parabolas</h1>

  <p>Before proceeding to parabolas, we need to
  define the distance between a point and a line.</p>

  <div class="definition">
    Let $P$ be a point and $L$ be a line. Define the distance
    between $P$ and $L$ (written $d(P,L)$) to be the length of the
    shortest line segment that has one end on $L$ and the other end
    on $P$. Note: This segment will always be perpendicular to $L$.
  </div>

  <div class="definition">
    Given a point $P$ (called the focus) and a line $L$ (called the
    directrix) which does not pass through $P$, we define a
    parabola as the set of all points $Q$ in the plane so that the
    distance from $P$ to $Q$ equals the distance from $Q$ to $L$.
    The vertex is the point on the parabola that is closest to the
    directrix.
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <div class="marginpar bmw">See page 658.</div>
    Consider the line $L:y=-p$, the point $P=(0,p)$, and
    another point $Q=(x,y)$. Use the distance formula to show that
    an equation of a parabola with directrix $L$ and focus $P$ is
    $x^2=4py$. Then use your work to explain why an equation of a
    parabola with directrix $x=-p$ and focus $(p,0)$ is $y^2=4px$.
  </div>
  <p>Ask me about the reflective properties of parabolas in
  class, if I have not told you already. They are used in satellite
  dishes, long range telescopes, solar ovens, and more. The
  following problem provides the basis to these reflective
  properties and is optional. If you wish to present it, let me
  know. I'll have you type it up prior to presenting in class.</p>

  <div class="problem-nonum optional">
    Consider the parabola $x^2=4py$ with directrix $y=-p$ and focus
    $(0,p)$. Let $Q=(a,b)$ be some point on the parabola. Let $T$
    be the tangent line to $L$ at point $Q$. Show that the angle
    between $PQ$ and $T$ is the same as the angle between the line
    $x=a$ and $T$. This shows that a vertical ray coming down
    towards the parabola will reflect of the wall of a parabola and
    head straight towards the vertex.
  </div>
  <p>The next two problems will help you use the basic equations
  of a parabola, together with shifting and reflecting, to study
  all parabolas whose axis of symmetry is parallel to either the
  $x$ or $y$ axis.</p>

  <div class="problem">
    <div class="marginpar bmw">See 11.6: 9-14</div>

    Once the directrix and focus are known, we can give an
    equation of a parabola. For each of the following, give an
    equation of the parabola with the stated directrix and focus.
    Provide a sketch of each parabola.

    <ol>
      <li>The focus is $(0,3)$ and the directrix is $y=-3$.</li>

      <li>The focus is $(0,3)$ and the directrix is $y=1$.</li>

  <section><h1>Ellipses</h1>

  <div class="definition">
    Given two points $F_1$ and $F_2$ (called foci) and a fixed
    distance $d$, we define an ellipse as the set of all points $Q$
    in the plane so that the sum of the distances $F_1Q$ and $F_2Q$
    equals the fixed distance $d$. The center of the ellipse is the
    midpoint of the segment $F_1F_2$. The two foci define a line.
    Each of the two points on the ellipse that intersect this line
    is called a vertex. The major axis is the segment between the
    two vertexes. The minor axis is the largest segment
    perpendicular to the major axis that fits inside the ellipse.
  </div>

  <p>We can derive an equation of an ellipse in a manner very
  similar to how we obtained an equation of a parabola. The
  following problem will walk you through this. We will not have
  time to present this problem in class. However, if you would like
  to complete the problem and write up your solution on the wiki,
  you can obtain presentation points for doing so. Let me know if
  you are interested.</p>

  <div class="problem-nonum optional">
    Consider the ellipse produced by the fixed distance $d$ and the
    foci $F_1=(c,0)$ and $F_2=(-c,0)$. Let $(a,0)$ and $(-a,0)$ be
    the vertexes of the ellipse.

    <ol>
      <li>Show that $d=2a$ by considering the distances from $F_1$
      and $F_2$ to the point $Q=(a,0)$.</li>

      <li>Let $Q=(0,b)$ be a point on the ellipse. Show that
      $b^2+c^2=a^2$ by considering the distance between $Q$ and
      each focus.</li>

      <li>Let $Q=(x,y)$. By considering the distances between $Q$
      and the foci, show that an equation of the ellipse is
      $$\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1.$$</li>

      <li>Suppose the foci are along the $y$-axis (at $(0,\pm c)$)
      and the fixed distance $d$ is now $d=2b$, with vertexes
      $(0,\pm b)$. Let $(a,0)$ be a point on the $x$ axis that
      intersect the ellipse. Show that we still have
      $$\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1,$$ but now we instead
      have $a^2+c^2=b^2$.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p>You'll want to use the results of the previous problem to
  complete the problems below. The key equation above is
  $\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$. The foci will be on the
  $x$-axis if $a&gt;b$, and will be on the $y$-axis if $b&gt;a$.
  The second part of the problem above shows that the distance from
  the center of the ellipse to the vertex is equal to the
  hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs go from the center to a
  focus, and from the center to an end point of the minor axis. The
  next three problems will help you use the basic equations of an
  ellipse, together with shifting and reflecting, to study all
  ellipses whose major axis is parallel to either the $x$- or
  $y$-axis.</p>

  <div class="problem">
    <div class="marginpar bmw">See 11.6: 17-24</div>

    For each ellipse below, graph the ellipse and give the
    coordinates of the foci and vertexes.

    <ol>
      <li>$\ds 16x^2+25y^2=400$ [Hint: divide by 400.]</li>

      <li>$\ds \frac{(x-1)^2}{5}+\frac{(y-2)^2}{9}=1$</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    For the ellipse $x^2+2x+2y^2-8y=9$, sketch a graph and give the
    coordinates of the foci and vertexes.
  </div>

  <div class="problem">

    Given an equation of each ellipse described below, and
    provide a rough sketch.

    <ol>
      <li>The foci are at $(2\pm 3,1)$ and vertices at $(2\pm 5,
      1)$.</li>

      <li>The foci are at $(-1,3\pm 2)$ and vertices at $(-1, 3\pm
      5)$.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p>Ask me about the reflective properties of an ellipse in
  class, if I have not told you already. The following problem
  provides the basis to these reflective properties and is
  optional. If you wish to present it, let me know. I'll have you
  type it up prior to presenting in class.</p>

  <div class="problem*" label="Optional">
    Consider the ellipse $\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$ with
    foci $F_1=(c,0)$ and $F_2=(-c,0)$. Let $Q=(x,y)$ be some point
    on the ellipse. Let $T$ be the tangent line to the ellipse at
    point $Q$. Show that the angle between $F_1Q$ and $T$ is the
    same as the angle between $F_2Q$ and $T$. This shows that a ray
    from $F_1$ to $Q$ will reflect off the wall of the ellipse at
    $Q$ and head straight towards the other focus $F_2$.
  </div>

  </section><section><h1>Hyperbolas</h1>

  <div class="definition">
    Given two points $F_1$ and $F_2$ (called foci) and a fixed
    number $d$, we define a hyperbola as the set of all points $Q$
    in the plane so that the difference of the distances $F_1Q$ and
    $F_2Q$ equals the fixed number $d$ or $-d$. The center of the
    hyperbola is the midpoint of the segment $F_1F_2$. The two foci
    define a line. Each of the two points on the hyperbola that
    intersect this line is called a vertex.
  </div>

  <p>We can derive an equation of a hyperbola in a manner very
  similar to how we obtained an equation of an ellipse. The
  following problem will walk you through this. We will not have
  time to present this problem in class.</p>

  <div class="problem-nonum optional">
    Consider the hyperbola produced by the fixed number $d$ and the
    foci $F_1=(c,0)$ and $F_2=(-c,0)$. Let $(a,0)$ and $(-a,0)$ be

    <ol>
      <li>Show that $d=2a$ by considering the difference of the
      distances from $F_1$ and $F_2$ to the vertex $(a,0)$.</li>

      <li>Let $Q=(x,y)$ be a point on the hyperbola. By considering
      the difference of the distances between $Q$ and the foci,
      show that an equation of the hyperbola is
      $\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{c^2-a^2}=1,$ or if we let
      $c^2-a^2=b^2$, then the equation is
      $$\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1.$$</li>

      <li>Suppose the foci are along the $y$-axis (at $(0,\pm c)$)
      and the number $d$ is now $d=2b$, with vertexes $(0,\pm b)$.
      Let $a^2=c^2-b^2$. Show that an equation of the hyperbola is

    at the origin with corners at $(a, \pm b)$ and $(-a,\pm b)$.
    Draw lines through the diagonals of this box. Rewrite the
    equation of the hyperbola by solving for $y$ and then factoring
    to show that as $x$ gets large, the hyperbola gets really close
    to the lines $y=\pm \frac{b}{a}x$. [Hint: rewrite so that you
    obtain $y=\pm\frac{b}{a}x\sqrt{\text{something}}$]. These two
    lines are often called oblique asymptotes. Now apply what you

  <section><h1>Parametric Equations</h1>

  <p>In middle school, you learned to
  write an equation of a line as $y=mx+b$. In the vector unit, we
  learned to write this in vector form as $(x,y)=(1,m)t+(0,b)$. The
  equation to the left is called a vector equation. It is
  equivalent to writing the two equations $$x=1t+0,y=mt+b,$$ which
  we will call parametric equations of the line. We were able to
  quickly develop equations of lines in space, by just adding a
  third equation for $z$. Parametric equations provide us with a
  way of specifying the location $(x,y,z)$ of an object by giving
  an equation for each coordinate. We will use these equations to
  model motion in the plane and in space. In this section we'll
  focus mostly on planar curves.</p>

  <div class="definition">
    If each of $f$ and $g$ are continuous functions, then the curve
    in the plane defined by $x=f(t),y=g(t)$ is called a parametric
    curve, and the equations $x=f(t),y=g(t)$ are called parametric
    equations for the curve. You can generalize this definition to
    3D and beyond by just adding more variables.
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <div class="marginpar bmw">See 11.1: 1-18. This is the same for all
      the problems below.</div>

    By plotting points, construct graphs of the three
    parametric curves given below (just make a $t,x,y$ table, and

    the foci of the resulting conic section. [Hint: this problem

    equation, and then plot the curve.]
  </div>

  <section><h1 id="derivatives-and-tangent-lines">Derivatives and Tangent
  lines</h1>

  <p>We're now ready to discuss calculus on parametric
  curves. The derivative of a vector valued function is defined
  using the same definition as first semester calculus.</p>

  <div class="definition">
    If $\vec r(t)$ is a vector equation of a curve (or in
    parametric form just $x=f(t), y=g(t)$), then we define the
    derivative to be $$\frac{d\vec r}{dt}=\ds\lim_{h\to
    0}\frac{\vec r(t+h)-\vec r(t)}{h}.$$
  </div>

  <p>The subtraction above requires vector subtraction. The
  following problem will provide a simple way to take derivatives
  which we will use all semester long.</p>

  <div class="problem">
    <div class="marginpar bmw">See page 728.</div>

    Show that if $\vec r(t) = (f(t),g(t))$, then the
    derivative is just $\frac{d\vec r}{dt} = (f'(t),g'(t))$. [The
    definition above says that $\frac{d\vec r}{dt}=\ds\lim_{h\to
    0}\frac{\vec r(t+h)-\vec r(t)}{h}$. We were told $\vec r(t) =
    (f(t),g(t))$, so use this in the derivative definition. Then
    try to modify the equation to obtain $\frac{d\vec r}{dt} =
    (f'(t),g'(t))$.]
  </div>

  <p>The previous problem shows you can take the derivative of a
  vector valued function by just differentiating each component
  separately. The next problem shows you that velocity and
  acceleration are still connected to the first and second
  derivatives.</p>

    \label{definition velocity acceleration} If an object moves

    not a vector. The speed of an object is just the length of the

    <p>The previous problem introduced the following key theorem.
    Its proof is just the chain rule.</p>

    <div class="theorem">
      If $\vec r(t) = (x(t),y(t))$ is a parametric curve, then the
      slope $dy/dx$ of the curve can be found using the formula
      $$\ds\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{dt}\frac{dt}{dx} =
      \frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}.$$ The second derivative is then
      $\ds\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{d(y'(x))}{dx} =
      \frac{d(dy/dx)}{dx}=\frac{d(dy/dx)/dt}{dx/dt}$. 
    </div>
    <p>An easy way to remember this theorem is to find
    $\frac{dy}{dx}$, just find the derivative of $y$ with respect
    to $t$, and then divide by $dx/dt$. This will allow you to
    connect derivatives of vector valued functions to slopes and
    derivatives back in first semester calculus.</p>

  <p>If an object moves at a
  constant speed, then the distance travelled is $$\text{distance}
  = \text{speed}\times\text{time}.$$ This requires that the speed
  be constant. What if the speed is not constant? Over a really
  small time interval $dt$, the speed is almost constant, so we can
  still use the idea above. The following problem will help you
  develop the key formula for arc length.</p>

  "Derivation of the arc length formula">
    Suppose an object moves along the path given by $\vec
    r(t)=(x(t),y(t))$ for $a\leq t\leq b$.

      <li>Show that the object's speed at any time $t$ is
      $\ds\sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2+\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2}$.</li>

      <li>If you move over a really small time interval, say of
      length $dt$, then the speed is almost constant. If you move
      at constant speed
      $\ds\sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2+\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2}$
      for a time length $dt$, what's the distance $ds$ you have

              Draw a small curve. Pick two points close
              together. Construct a straight line segment between
              them (call this $ds$). Then draw a right triangle
              that shows the change in $x$ and change in $y$
              (written $dx$ and $dy$). Use the Pythagorean theorem
              to show that
              $ds=\sqrt{dx^2+dy^2}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2+\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2}dt$.

    Find the length of the curve $\ds \vec r(t) =
    \left(t^3,\frac{3t^2}{2}\right)$ for $t\in[1,3]$. The notation
    $t\in[1,3]$ means $1\leq t\leq 3$. Be prepared to show us your
    integration steps in class (you'll need a $u$-substitution).
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    For each curve below, set up an integral formula which would
    give the length, and sketch the curve. Do not worry about
    integrating them.

    <div class="marginpar">
      The reason I don't want you to actually compute the integrals
      is that they will get ugly really fast. Try doing one in
      Wolfram Alpha and see what the computer gives.

  <p>To actually compute the integrals above and find the
  lengths, we would use a numerical technique to approximate the
  integral (something akin to adding up the areas of lots and lots
  of rectangles as you did in first semester calculus).</p>
