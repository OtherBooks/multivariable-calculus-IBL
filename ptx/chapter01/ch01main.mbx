  <title>Review: Calculus I <ampersand /> II</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      When you complete this unit you should be able to:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Summarize the ideas you learned in Calculus I and II, including graphing, derivatives (product, quotient, power, chain, trig, exponential, and logarithm rules), and integration (<m>u</m>-sub and integration by parts).
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Compute the differential <m>dy</m> of a function and use it to approximate the change in a function.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Illustrate how to solve systems of linear equations, including how to express a solution parametrically (in terms of <m>t</m>) when there are infinitely many solutions.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Extend the idea of differentials to approximate functions using parabolas, cubics, and polynomials of any degree.
          </p>
