  <introduction>
    <p>
      After completing this unit you will be able to...
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Convert between rectangular and polar coordinates in 2D. Convert between rectangular and cylindrical or spherical in 3D.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Graph polar functions in the plane. Find intersections of polar equations, and illustrate that not every intersection can be obtained algebraically (you may have to graph the curves).
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Find derivatives and tangent lines in polar coordinates.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Find area and arc length using polar equations.
          </p>
