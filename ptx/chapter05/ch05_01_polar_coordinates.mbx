  <title>Polar Coordinates</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Up to now, we have most often given the location of a point (or coordiantes of a vector) by stating the <m>(x,y)</m> coordinates. These are called the Cartesian (or rectangular) coordinates. Some problems are much easier to work with if we know how far a point is from the origin, together with the angle between the <m>x</m>-axis and a ray from the origin to the point.

      In <xref ref="prob_polar_coordinate_equations">problem</xref>, you should have obtained the equations
      <me>
        x=r\cos\theta,  y=r\sin\theta.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can write this in vector notation as <m>\begin{pmatrix}x\\y
      \end{pmatrix} =\begin{pmatrix}r\cos\theta\\ r\sin\theta
      \end{pmatrix}</m>.
      This is a vector equation in which you input polar coordinates <m>(r,\theta)</m> and get out Cartesian coordinates <m>(x,y)</m>.
      So you input one thing to get out one thing, which means that we have a function.
      We could write <m>\vec T(r,\theta) = (r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)</m>, where we've used the letter <m>T</m> as the name of the function because it is a transformation between coordinate systems.
      To emphasize that the domain and range are both two dimensional systems, we could also write <m>T:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}^2</m>. In the next chapter, we'll spend more time with this notation.

      To construct a graph of a polar curve, just create an <m>r,\theta</m> table. Choose values for <m>\theta</m> that will make it easy to compute any trig functions involved. Then connect the points in a smooth manner, making sure that your radius grows or shrinks appropriately as your angle increases.
