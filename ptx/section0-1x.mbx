    From Dr. Woodruff:

  <p>
    This course may be like no other course in mathematics you have ever taken. We'll discuss in class some of the key differences, and eventually this section will contain a complete description of how this course works. For now, it's just a skeleton.

    I received the following email about 6 months after a student took the course:

  <blockquote>
      Hey Brother Woodruff,

      I was reading <em>Knowledge of Spiritual Things</em> by Elder Scott.
      I thought the following quote would be awesome to share with your
      students, especially those in Math 215 :)
      <blockquote>
      Profound [spiritual] truth cannot simply be poured
      from one mind and heart to another. It takes faith
      and diligent effort. Precious truth comes a small
      piece at a time through faith, with great exertion,
      and at times wrenching struggles.
      </blockquote>

      </blockquote>

  <p>
    Elder Scott's words perfectly describe how we acquire mathematical truth, as well as spiritual truth.
