<p id="p-1573">Suppose an ant walks around the circle \(g(x,y)=x^2+y^2=1\text{.}\) As the ant walks around the circle, the temperature is \(f(x,y) = x^2+y+4\text{.}\) Our goal is to find the maximum and minimum temperatures reached by the ant as it walks around the circle. We want to optimize \(f(x,y)\) subject to the constraint \(g(x,y)=1\text{.}\) </p>
<ol id="ol-205" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-814"><p id="p-1574">Draw the circle \(g(x,y)=1\text{.}\)  Then, on the same set of axes, draw several level curves of \(f\text{.}\) The level curves \(f=3, 4, 5, 6\) are a good start. Then add more (maybe at each 1/4th). If you make a careful, accurate graph, it will help a lot below.</p></li>
<li id="li-815"><p id="p-1575">Based solely on your graph, where does the minimum temperature occur?  What is the minimum temperature?</p></li>
<li id="li-816"><p id="p-1576">If the ant is at the point \((0,1)\text{,}\) and it moves left, will the temperature rise or fall?  What if the ant moves right?</p></li>
<li id="li-817"><p id="p-1577">On your graph, place a dot(s) where you believe the ant reaches a maximum temperature (it may occur at more than one spot).</p></li>
<li id="li-818"><p id="p-1578">Explain why you believe this is the spot where the maximum temperature occurs. What about the level curves tells you that these spots should be a maximum?</p></li>
<li id="li-819"><p id="p-1579">Draw the gradient of \(f\) at the places where the minimum and maximum temperatures occur. Also draw the gradient of \(g\) at these spots.</p></li>
<li id="li-820"><p id="p-1580">Explain how are gradients of \(f\) and \(g\) related at these spots.</p></li>
