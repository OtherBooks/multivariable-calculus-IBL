<p id="p-1395">This exercise reinforces what you just did with two points in the previous exercise. However, it now involves two people on a seesaw. EXTRA<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-239" id="fn-239"><span class="footnote"><sup> 7 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-239" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">See <a class="external-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seesaw" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> for a seesaw picture.</span></span>Ignore the mass of the seesaw in your work below (pretend it's an extremely light seesaw, so its mass is negligible compared to the masses of the people). </p>
<ol id="ol-180" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-711"><p id="p-1396">My daughter and her friend are sitting on a seesaw.  Both girls have the same mass of 30 kg. My wife stands about 1 m behind my daughter. We'll measure distance in this exercise from my wife's perspective.  We can think of my daughter as a point mass located at \((1\text{m} ,0)\) whose mass is \(30\) kg. Suppose her friend is located at \((5\text{m} ,0)\text{.}\) Suppose the kids are sitting just right so that the seesaw is perfectly balanced.  That means the the center of mass of the girls is precisely at the pivot point (or center) of the seesaw. Find the distance from my wife to the pivot point by finding the center of mass of the two girls.</p></li>
<li id="li-712"><p id="p-1397">My daughter's friend has to leave, so I plan to take her place on the seesaw. My mass is 100 kg. Her friend was sitting at the point \((5,0)\text{.}\) I would like to sit at the point \((a,0)\) so that the seesaw is perfectly balanced. Without doing any computations, is \(a&gt;5\) or \(a\lt 5\text{?}\) Explain.</p></li>
<li id="li-713"><p id="p-1398">Suppose I sit at the spot \((x,0)\) (perhaps causing my daughter or I to have a highly unbalanced ride). Find the center of mass of the two points \((1,0)\) and \((x,0)\) whose masses are \(30\) and \(100\text{,}\) respectively (units are meters and kilograms).</p></li>
<li id="li-714"><p id="p-1399">Where should I sit so that the seesaw is perfectly balanced (what is \(a\))?</p></li>
