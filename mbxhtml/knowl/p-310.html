      We can derive an equation of an ellipse in a manner very similar to how we obtained an equation of a parabola. The following problem will walk you through this. \bmw{We will not have time to present this problem in class. However, if you would like to complete the problem and write up your solution on the wiki, you can obtain presentation points for doing so. Let me know if you are interested. }
