    We now generalize the second derivative test to all dimensions. We've already seen that the second derivative of a function such as \(z=f(x,y)\) is a square matrix. The second derivative test in Calculus I/II relied on understanding if a function was concave up or concave down. We need a way to examine the concavity of \(f\) as we approach a point \((x,y)\) from any of the infinitely many directions. Such a method exists, and leads to an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem. I'm assuming that most of you have never heard the word “eigenvalue.” We could spend an entire semester just studying eigenvectors. We'd need a few weeks to discover what they are from a exercise-based approach. Instead, here is an example of how to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
