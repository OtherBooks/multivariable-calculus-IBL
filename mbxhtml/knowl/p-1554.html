        Prof. Woodruff's daughter has asked for a Barbie princess cake. He purchased a metal pan that's roughly in the shape of a paraboloid \(z=f(x,y)=9-x^2-y^2\) for \(z\geq 0\text{.}\). To surprise her, he want to hide a present inside the cake. The present is a bunch of small candy that can pretty much fill a box of any size. He'd like to know how large (biggest volume) of a rectangular box he can fit under the cake, so that when she start cutting the cake, she'll find her surprise present. The box will start at \(z=0\) and the corners of the box (located at \((x,\pm y)\) and \((-x,\pm y)\)) will touch the surface of the cake \(z=9-x^2-y^2\text{.}\).
