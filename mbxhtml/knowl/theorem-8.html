</h5>
<p id="p-1530">Let \(f(x,y)\) be a function so that all the second partial derivatives exist and are continuous. The second derivative of \(f\text{,}\) written \(D^2f\) and sometimes called the Hessian of \(f\text{,}\) is a square matrix. Let \(\lambda_1\) be the largest eigenvalue of \(D^2f\text{,}\) and \(\lambda_2\) be the smallest eigenvalue. Then \(\lambda_1\) is the largest possible second derivative obtained in any direction. Similarly, the smallest possible second derivative obtained in any direction is \(\lambda_2\text{.}\) The eigenvectors give the directions in which these extreme second derivatives are obtained. The second derivative test states the following.</p>
<blockquote>Suppose \((a,b)\) is a critical point of \(f\text{,}\) meaning \(Df(a,b) = \begin{bmatrix}0\amp 0
\end{bmatrix}\text{.}\) <ul id="ul-57" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-789"><p id="p-1531">If all the eigenvalues of \(D^2f(a,b)\) are positive, then in every direction the function is concave upwards at \((a,b)\) which means the function has a local minimum at \((a,b)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li id="li-790"><p id="p-1532">If all the eigenvalues of \(D^2f(a,b)\) are negative, then in every direction the function is concave downwards at \((a,b)\text{.}\) This means the function has a local maximum at \((a,b)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li id="li-791"><p id="p-1533">If the smallest eigenvalue of \(D^2f(a,b)\) is negative, and the largest eigenvalue of \(D^2f(a,b)\) is positive, then  in one direction the function is concave upwards, and in another the function is concave downwards. The point \((a,b)\) is called a saddle point.</p></li>
<li id="li-792"><p id="p-1534">If the largest or smallest eigenvalue of \(f\) equals 0, then the second derivative tests yields no information.</p></li>
