      Each derivative rule from the front cover of your calculus text is also an integration rule. In addition to these basic rules, we'll need to know three integration techniques. They are
      (1) {\(u\)}-substitution,
      (2) integration-by-parts, and
      (3) integration by using software.
      There are many other integration techniques, but we will not focus on them. If you are trying to compute an integral to get a number while on the job, then software will almost always be the tool you use. As we develop new ideas in this and future classes (in engineering, physics, statistics, math), you'll find that \(u\)-substitution and integrations-by-parts show up so frequently that knowing when and how to apply them becomes crucial.
