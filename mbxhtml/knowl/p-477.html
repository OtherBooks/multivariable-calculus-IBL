    We will focus most of our time this semester on two- and three-dimensional problems. However, many problems in the real world require a higher number of dimensions. When you hear the word “dimension”, it does not always represent a physical dimension, such as length, width, or height. If a quantity depends on 30 different measurements, then the problem involves 30 dimensions. As a quick illustration, the formula for the distance between two points depends on 6 numbers, so distance is really a 6-dimensional problem. As another example, if a piece of equipment has a color, temperature, age, and cost, we can think of that piece of equipment being represented by a point in four-dimensional space (where the coordinate axes represent color, temperature, age, and cost).
