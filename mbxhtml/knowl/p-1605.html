    Before we introduce integration, let's practice using inequalities to describe regions in the plane. In first semester calculus, we often use the inequalities \(a\leq x\leq b\) and \(g(x)\leq y\leq f(x)\) to describe the region above \(g\) below \(f\) for \(x\) between \(a\) and \(b\text{.}\). We trapped \(x\) between two constants, and \(y\) between two functions. Sometimes we wrote \(c\leq y\leq d\) where \(g(y)\leq x\leq f(y)\) to describe the region to the right of \(g\) and left of \(f\) for \(y\) between \(c\) and \(d\text{.}\). We need to practice writing inequalities in this form, as these inequalities provide us the bounds of integration for double integrals.
