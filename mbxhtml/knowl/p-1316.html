    If you are familiar with kinetic energy, then you should notice a key idea here. Work is a transfer of energy. As an object falls, energy is transferred from potential energy to kinetic energy. The total kinetic energy at the end of a fall is precisely equal to the difference between the potential energy at the top of the fall and the potential energy at the bottom of the fall (neglecting air resistance). So work (the transfer of energy) is exactly the difference in potential energy.
