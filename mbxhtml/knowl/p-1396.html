                My daughter and her friend are sitting on a seesaw.  Both girls have the same mass of 30 kg. My wife stands about 1 m behind my daughter. We'll measure distance in this exercise from my wife's perspective.  We can think of my daughter as a point mass located at \((1\text{m} ,0)\) whose mass is \(30\) kg. Suppose her friend is located at \((5\text{m} ,0)\text{.}\). Suppose the kids are sitting just right so that the seesaw is perfectly balanced.  That means the the center of mass of the girls is precisely at the pivot point (or center) of the seesaw. Find the distance from my wife to the pivot point by finding the center of mass of the two girls.
