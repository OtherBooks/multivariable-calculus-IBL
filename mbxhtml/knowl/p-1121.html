          Imagine that you are riding as a passenger on a road and encounter a series of switchbacks (so the road starts to zigzag up the mountain). Right before each bend in the road, you see a yellow sign that tells you a U-turn is coming up, and that you should reduce your speed from 45 mi/hr to 15 mi/hr. Assume the largest curvature along the turn is \(\kappa\text{.}\). Recall that \(a_N=\kappa |\vec v|^2\text{.}\). The engineers of the road designed the road so that if you are moving at 15 mi/hr, then the normal acceleration will be at most \(A\) units.
          </p>
<ol id="ol-145" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-559"><p id="p-1122">Suppose that your driver (Ben) ignores the suggestion to slow down to 15 mi/hr.  He keeps going 45 mi/hr through the turn. Had he slowed down, the max acceleration would be \(A\text{.}\)  You're traveling 3 times faster than suggested.  What will your maximum normal acceleration be? <span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-hint-42" id="hint-42"><span class="heading"><span class="type">Hint</span></span></a></span><span id="hk-hint-42" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="solution"><p id="p-1123">It's more than \(3A\text{.}\)</p></span></span></p></li>
<li id="li-560"><p id="p-1124">You yell at Ben to slow down (you don't want to die). So Ben decides to only slow to 30 mi/hr. He figures this means you'll only feel twice as much acceleration as \(A\text{.}\)  Explain why this line of reasoning is flawed.</p></li>
<li id="li-561"><p id="p-1125">Ben gets frustrated by the fact that he has to slow down. He complains about the engineers who designed the road, and says, “they should have just built a larger corner so I could keep going 45.”  How much larger should the radius of the circle be so that you can travel 45 mi/hr instead of 15 mi/hr, and still feel the same acceleration \(A\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li id="li-562"><p id="p-1126">Which will cause the normal acceleration to decrease more, halving your speed or halving the curvature (doubling the radius)?</p></li>
</ol>
