      Now that we can describe motion, let's turn our attention to the work done by a vector field as we move through the field. Work is a transfer of energy.

<ul id="ul-44" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-580"><p id="p-1168">A tornado picks might pick up a couch, and applies forces to the couch as the couch swirls around the center. Work transfers the energy from the tornado to then couch, giving the cough it's kinetic energy.</p></li>
<li id="li-581"><p id="p-1169">When an object falls, gravity does work on the object. The work done by gravity converts potential energy to kinetic energy.</p></li>
<li id="li-582"><p id="p-1170">If we consider the flow of water down a river, it's gravity that gives the water its kinetic energy. We can place a hydro electric dam next to river to capture a lot of this kinetic energy.  Work transfers the kinetic energy of the river to rotational energy of the turbine, which eventually ends up as electrical energy available in our homes.</p></li>
