      When something rotates, we need a handy way to compute its kinetic energy.
      We'll show that the kinetic energy of an object that is rotating about a line \(L\text{,}\), and has an angular velocity of \(\omega\) radians per second about the line, is precisely
      EXTRA<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-269" id="fn-269"><span class="footnote"><sup> 13 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-269" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Compare the two formulas \(KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2\) and \(KE = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2\text{.}\)  If we replace speed with angular speed, then we replace mass with inertia.  Heavy objects are hard to push. Objects with large inertia are hard to rotate.  Just as mass is an objects resistance to being moved, inertia is an objects resistance to being rotated.  Engineers build I-beams so that a large portion of the mass is far from the axis of rotation. This causes a large inertia, which prevents I-beams from rotating.</span></span>
      
\begin{equation*}
KE = \frac{1}{2}I \omega^2,
\end{equation*}

      where \(I\) is the (second) moment of inertia.
      If an object has a large inertia, it takes a lot of work (transfer of energy) to get the object rotating. Inertia is like an object's resistance to rotational motion.
