  Hey Brother Woodruff,

  I was reading Knowledge of Spiritual Things by Elder Scott.
  I thought the following quote would be awesome to share with your
  students, especially those in Math 215 :)
  
  Profound [spiritual] truth cannot simply be poured
  from one mind and heart to another. It takes faith
  and diligent effort. Precious truth comes a small
  piece at a time through faith, with great exertion,
  and at times wrenching struggles.
