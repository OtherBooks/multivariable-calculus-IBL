    <a knowl="./knowl/unit6_content.html" knowl-id="xref-unit6_content" alt="Exercise 8.2.5 " title="Exercise 8.2.5 ">ExerciseÂ 8.2.5</a> is precisely the content to this chapter. We just need to add some vocabulary to make it easier to talk about what we just did. Let's introduce the vocabulary in terms of the exercise above, and then make a formal definition.
    </p>
<ul id="ul-23" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-354"><p id="p-724">The derivative of \(f\) in the previous exercise is the matrix
\begin{equation*}
Df(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix}2xy+3\amp  
x^2+20\cos(5y)
\end{bmatrix} .
\end{equation*}
Some people call this the total derivative, as it's made up of two parts, called partial derivatives.</p></li>
<li id="li-355"><p id="p-725">The first column of this matrix is just part of the whole derivative. We can get the first column by holding \(y\) constant, and then differentiating with respect to \(x\text{.}\) This is precisely a partial derivative.  We'll write this as \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2xy+3\text{,}\) or sometimes just \(f_x = 2xy+3\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li id="li-356"><p id="p-726">The second column of the derivative is the partial of \(f\) with respect to \(y\text{.}\) We can get the second column by holding \(x\) constant, and then differentiating with respect to \(y\text{.}\) We'll write this as \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x^2+20\cos(5y)\text{,}\) or \(f_y = x^2+20\cos(5y)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li id="li-357"><p id="p-727">Remember, the derivative of \(f\) is a matrix. The columns of the matrix are the partial derivatives with respect to the input variables.</p></li>
