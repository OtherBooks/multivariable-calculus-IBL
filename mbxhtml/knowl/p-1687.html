      This same process gives the center of mass. We could replace the variable distance \(x\) in \(\int_C x dm\) with the constant distance \(\bar x\text{,}\), and then solve for \(\bar x\) in the equation \(\int_C \bar xdm = \int_C x dm\text{.}\).
      If all the mass were located at one spot, what would that spot have to be for the first moments of mass to be the same. The radii of gyration are obtained in the exact same manner. We'll think of a radius of gyration as a rotational center of mass.
