</h5>This definition is not really a definition.  It is actually a theorem.  If you use the formula given as the definition, then you would need to prove the three facts. We have the tools to give a complete proof of (1) and (3), but we would need a course in linear algebra to prove (2). It shouldn't be too much of a surprise that the cross product is related to area, since it is defined in terms of determinants</span><span class="incontext"><a href="section-12.html#fn-35">in-context</a></span>
