      Consider the 2 by 2 matrix \(\begin{bmatrix}3\amp 1\\0\amp 2
\end{bmatrix}\) whose determinant is \(3\cdot 2-0\cdot 1=6\text{.}\). Draw the column vectors \(\begin{bmatrix}3\\0
\end{bmatrix}\) and \(\begin{bmatrix}1\\2
\end{bmatrix}\) with their base at the origin (see <a knowl="./knowl/detfig.html" knowl-id="xref-detfig" alt="Figure 2.3.5 " title="Figure 2.3.5 ">figure 2.3.5</a>).
      These two vectors give the edges of a parallelogram whose area is the determinant \(6\text{.}\). If I swap the order of the two vectors in the matrix, then the determinant of \(\begin{bmatrix}1\amp 3\\2\amp 0
\end{bmatrix}\) is \(-6\text{.}\). The reason for the difference is that the determinant not only keeps track of area, but also order. Starting at the first vector, if you can turn counterclockwise through an angle smaller than 180\(^\circ\) to obtain the second vector, then the determinant is positive. If you have to turn clockwise instead, then the determinant is negative. This is often termed “the right-hand rule,” as rotating the fingers of your right hand from the first vector to the second vector will cause your thumb to point up precisely when the determinant is positive.
