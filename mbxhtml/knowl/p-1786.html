    To understand what the circulation and flux density mean in a physical sense, think of \(\vec F\) as the velocity field of some gas.
    </p>
<ul id="ul-66" style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-919"><p id="p-1787">The circulation density tells us the rate at which the vector field \(\vec F\) causes objects to rotate around points.  If circulation density is positive, then particles near \((x,y)\) would tend to circulate around the point in a counterclockwise direction. The larger the circulation density, the faster the rotation. The velocity field of a gas could have some regions where the gas is swirling clockwise, and some regions where the gas is swirling counterclockwise.</p></li>
<li id="li-920"><p id="p-1788">The divergence, or flux density, tells us the rate at which the vector field causes object to either flee from \((x,y)\) or come towards \((x,y)\text{.}\) For the velocity field of a gas, the gas is expanding at points where the divergence is positive, and contracting at points where the divergence is negative.</p></li>
