    In this section we'll return to the concept of work. Many vector fields are actually the derivative of a function. When this occurs, computing work along a curve is extremely easy. All you have to know is the endpoints of the curve, and the function \(f\) whose derivative gives you the vector field. This function is called a potential for a vector field. Once we are comfortable finding potentials, we'll show that the work done by such a vector field is the difference in the potential at the end points. This makes finding work extremely fast.
