<p id="p-1554">Prof. Woodruff's daughter has asked for a Barbie princess cake. He purchased a metal pan that's roughly in the shape of a paraboloid \(z=f(x,y)=9-x^2-y^2\) for \(z\geq 0\text{.}\) To surprise her, he want to hide a present inside the cake. The present is a bunch of small candy that can pretty much fill a box of any size. He'd like to know how large (biggest volume) of a rectangular box he can fit under the cake, so that when she start cutting the cake, she'll find her surprise present. The box will start at \(z=0\) and the corners of the box (located at \((x,\pm y)\) and \((-x,\pm y)\)) will touch the surface of the cake \(z=9-x^2-y^2\text{.}\) </p>

<li id="li-802"><p id="p-1555">What is the function \(V(x,y)\) that we are trying to maximize?</p></li>
<li id="li-803"><p id="p-1556">If you find all the critical points of \(V\text{,}\) you'll discover there are 9.  However, only one of these critical points makes sense in the context of this exercise. Find that critical point.</p></li>
<li id="li-804"><p id="p-1557">Use the second derivative test to prove that the critical point yields a maximum volume.</p></li>
<li id="li-805"><p id="p-1558">What are the dimensions of the box? What's the volume of the box?</p></li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p id="p-1559">The only thing left for Prof. Woodruff to now determine how much candy he should buy to fill the box. He'll take care of that.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-39.html#optimize_box_in_cake">in-context</a></span>
