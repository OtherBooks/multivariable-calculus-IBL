    We started with motion on a circle with a relatively simple speed. We then multiplied the speed by 5, and then chose a variable speed. You should have noticed that at the same point on the curve, regardless of speed, the quantities \(\vec T\text{,}\), \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\text{,}\), and \(\left|\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\right|\) remained the same. Will this pattern continue if we were to change from constant speeds to variable speeds? What if we left the path of a circle, and moved to any smooth curve? How far can we take this pattern? Is it true always? If so, then the quantities \(\vec T\text{,}\), \(\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\text{,}\), and \(\left|\dfrac{d\vec T}{ds}\right|\) are pretty important quantities that describe the curve we're on.
