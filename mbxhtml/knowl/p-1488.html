<p>
        Suppose you are looking at a topographical map (see <a class="external-url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_map" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> for an example). On this topographical map, each contour line represents 100 ft in elevation. You notice in one section of the map that the contour lines are really close together, and they start to form circles around a spot on the graph. You notice in another section of the map that the contour lines are spaced quite far apart. Let \(f(x,y)\) be the elevation of the land, so that the topographical map is just a contour plot of \(f\text{.}\).

Just make sure your map has a section with some contours that are closely packed together, and some that are far apart, as well as a contour that intersects itself. Then on your topographical map, please add a few gradient vectors, where you emphasize which ones are long, and which ones are short. Show us how to find a peak, as well as what the gradient vector would be at the peak.</p></li>
