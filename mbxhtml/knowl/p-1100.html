      When a civil engineering team builds a road, they have to pay attention to the curvature of the road. If the curvature of the road is too large, accidents will happen and the civil engineering team will be liable. How do they make sure the curvature never gets to large? They use the circle of curvature. When they want to cause a road to turn, they'll find the center of curvature, send a surveyor out to the center, and then have the surveyor make sure that the road follows the circle of curvature for a short distance. They actually pace out the circle of curvature and then build the road along this circle for a hundred feet or so. Then, they recompute the radius of curvature (if they need the direction to change again), and pace out another circle. In this way, they can guarantee that the curvature never gets large. In the next section we'll see how curvature is directly related to normal acceleration (which is what causes semis to tip, and vehicles to slide off icy roads.)
