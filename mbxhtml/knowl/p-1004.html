    Imagine that you are at a park with some kids (a nephew, a daughter, etc.). The park has a merry-go-round where the kids can sit down, hold on, and then spin in circles. As the spinning speed increases, they'll feel a greater force trying to throw them outwards. To stay on the merry-go-round, they have to counteract this outward acceleration with their own inward acceleration. For the next few examples, let's examine the connections between \(\vec v\text{,}\), \(\vec a\text{,}\), \(\vec T\text{,}\), \(d\vec T/dt\text{,}\), \(d\vec T/ds\text{,}\), and \(|d\vec T/ds|\) in the context of spinning around on a merry-go-round. These few examples are enough to develop just about the entire chapter.
