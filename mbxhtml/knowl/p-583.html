      Most of our examples of function of the form \(w=f(x,y,z)\) can be drawn by using our knowledge about conic sections.

So the key idea is to set one of the variables equal to a constant and then graph the resulting curve. Repeat this with a few variables and a few constants, and you'll know what the surface is. Sometimes when you set a specific variable equal to a constant, you'll get an ellipse. If this occurs, try setting that variable equal to other constants, as ellipses are generally the easiest curves to draw.
