    Have you ever dropped a rock from the top of a waterfall, or skipped a rock across a lake. This section explores some simple connections between position, velocity, and acceleration. If we wanted to send a rocket to space, or shoot a missile across an ocean, the same principles will apply. If we know how much thrust a rocket provides (the acceleration), can we determine the velocity of our rocket at any time along its path? Could we predict the flight path of the rocket? To make a good flight plan, we'd need to know how to determine position and velocity from acceleration. That's the content of this section.
