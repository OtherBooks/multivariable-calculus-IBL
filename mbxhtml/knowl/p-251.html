    Suppose a heavy box needs to be lowered down a ramp.
    The box exerts a downward force of 200 Newtons, which we will write in vector notation as \(\vec F=\left\lt 0,-200\right&gt;\text{.}\).
    The ramp was placed so that the box needs to be moved right 6 m, and down 3 m, so we need to get from the origin \((0,0)\) to the point \((6,-3)\text{.}\). This displacement can be written as \(\vec d=\left\lt 6,-3\right&gt;\text{.}\). The force \(F\) acts straight down, which means the ramp takes some of the force. Our goal is to find out how much of the 200N the ramp takes, and how much force must be applied to prevent the box from sliding down the ramp (neglecting friction). We are going to break the force \(\vec F\) into two components, one component in the direction of \(\vec d\text{,}\), and another component orthogonal to \(\vec d\text{.}\).
