<p id="p-100">Suppose you are constructing a cube whose side length should be \(s=2\) units. The manufacturing process is not exact, but instead creates a cube with side lengths \(s=2+ds\) units. (You should assume that all sides are still the same, so any error on one side is replicated on all. We have to assume this for now, but before the semester ends we'll be able to do this with high dimensional calculus.)</p>

Note that the volume of the cube is \(V=s^3\text{.}\) Use a first, second, and third order approximation to estimate the increase in volume caused by the .3 increase in side length. Then compute the actual increase in volume \(V(2.3)-V(2)\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-8.html#exercise-22">in-context</a></span>
